The code below configures a large language model (LLM) for inference with quantization techniques for efficiency. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:\n\n**Model Path and Quantization Configuration**\n\n1. **Model Path:** The `model` variable stores the path to a pre-trained causal language model (likely a 2-billion parameter model) on Kaggle Datasets.\n\n2. **BitsAndBytesConfig:** The `bnbConfig` object defines the configuration for quantization using the BitsAndBytes library. Here are the key arguments:\n    * `load_in_4bit (bool, optional)`: This argument enables 4-bit quantization, reducing memory usage by approximately fourfold compared to the original model.\n    * `bnb_4bit_quant_type (str, optional)`: This parameter specifies the type of 4-bit quantization to use. Here, it's set to `\"nf4\"`, a specific quantization format supported by BitsAndBytes.\n    * `bnb_4bit_compute_dtype (torch.dtype, optional)`: This argument defines the data type used for computations during inference. Here, it's set to `torch.bfloat16`, a lower-precision format that can improve speed on compatible hardware.\n\n**Loading Tokenizer and Model with Quantization**\n\n1. **AutoTokenizer:** The `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` function loads the tokenizer associated with the pre-trained model at the specified path (`model`). The `quantization_config` argument is crucial here. It tells the tokenizer to consider the quantization information (e.g., potential padding changes) while processing text.\n\n2. **AutoModelForCausalLM:** Similarly, `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained` loads the actual LLM model from the path (`model`). Again, the `device_map=\"auto\"` argument allows automatic device placement (CPU or GPU) and the `quantization_config` ensures the model is loaded with the 4-bit quantization configuration.\n\n**Overall, this code snippet aims to achieve two goals:**\n\n* **Load a pre-trained LLM:** It retrieves a pre-trained causal language model from the specified path.\n* **Enable Quantization for Efficiency:** By using the `BitsAndBytesConfig` and arguments during loading, the code configures the tokenizer and model to leverage 4-bit quantization for memory reduction and potentially faster inference on compatible hardware.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3><strong>Know More about <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/code/lorentzyeung/what-s-4-bit-quantization-how-does-it-help-llama2\">4-bit quantization</a></strong></h3>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#model = \"/kaggle/input/m/google/gemma/transformers/2b-it/2\" #Zafor158/lora-alpaca\nmodel=\"/kaggle/input/m/google/gemma/transformers/2b-it/2\"\n\nbnbConfig = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n    load_in_4bit = True,\n    bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\",\n    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n)\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model, quantization_config=bnbConfig, device_map=\"auto\")\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model,\n    device_map = \"auto\",\n    quantization_config=bnbConfig\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-01T19:02:51.837720Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-01T19:02:51.838021Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-01T19:03:28.039575Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-01T19:02:51.837998Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-01T19:03:28.038933Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Loading checkpoint shards:   0%|          | 0/2 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"60d0a4462f3d40898a5a462ddff07cf5"}},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **4. Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG)**\n```Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)``` is a paradigm in language model architecture that integrates both retrieval and generation processes to enhance the model's understanding and response capabilities. In essence, it combines the strengths of retrieval-based models, which excel at accessing and utilizing external knowledge sources, with generative models, which can generate novel and contextually relevant responses.\n\nThe primary benefit of RAG in large language models (LLMs) is its ability to leverage external knowledge sources during the generation process. By retrieving relevant information from a predefined knowledge base or corpus, the model can augment its understanding of the input context and produce more accurate and informative responses. This approach not only improves the coherence and relevance of generated text but also enables the model to incorporate real-world knowledge and factual accuracy into its outputs.\n\nRAG aims to achieve several key objectives:\n\n1. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding:** By retrieving relevant information from external sources, RAG can better understand the context of a given prompt or query, leading to more contextually appropriate responses.\n\n2. **Improved Content Quality:** Integrating external knowledge sources allows RAG to generate content that is more accurate, informative, and relevant to the input context, enhancing the overall quality of generated text.\n\n3. **Factually Accurate Responses:** By accessing external knowledge bases, RAG can ensure that its responses are factually accurate and grounded in real-world information, reducing the likelihood of generating misleading or incorrect information.\n\nThe workflow of RAG typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Retrieval:** The model first retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base or corpus based on the input prompt or query. This retrieval process aims to identify key facts, concepts, or contextually relevant information to inform the generation process.\n\n2. **Augmentation:** The retrieved information is then used to augment the model's understanding of the input context. By incorporating this external knowledge, the model can generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\n\n3. **Generation:** Finally, the model generates a response based on the augmented understanding of the input context, leveraging both the original prompt and the retrieved information to produce a coherent and relevant output.\n\nThe necessity of using RAG lies in its ability to address the limitations of traditional generative models, such as lack of factual accuracy and coherence in responses. By integrating retrieval-based mechanisms, RAG can access external knowledge sources to enhance its understanding of the input context, leading to more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant generated text. This approach is particularly valuable in tasks requiring a deep understanding of complex topics or access to large knowledge bases, such as question answering, dialogue generation, and content summarization.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Load documents for RAG**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Instantiate a PyPDFDirectoryLoader object with the specified directory path\npdf_loader = PyPDFDirectoryLoader(\"/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488\")\n\n# Load PDF documents from the specified directory\npdfs = pdf_loader.load()\npdfs","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-01T20:21:14.922220Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-01T20:21:14.922551Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-01T20:23:52.170869Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-01T20:21:14.922526Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-01T20:23:52.169809Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"execution_count":59,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"[Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 0, 'page_label': '83'}, page_content='Disease: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm — see Aortic Aneurysm \\nURL: https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/aortic-aneurysm.html \\nDisease Information: Related Topics: Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture: A thoracic \\naortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic \\naortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age.4 Thoracic aortic \\naneurysms are usually caused byhigh blood pressureor sudden injury. Sometimes people \\nwith inherited connective tissue disorders, such asMarfan syndromeand Ehlers-Danlos \\nsyndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms. Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm \\ncan include the following: An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. \\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms. Abdominal \\naortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal \\naortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people.5 \\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis (hardened arteries), but \\ninfection or injury can also cause them.6 Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don\\'t have any \\nsymptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following: Aneurysms \\ncan happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause \\nastroke. Peripheral aneurysms?those found in arteries other than the aorta?can happen in \\nthe neck, in the groin, or behind the knees. These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or \\ndissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away \\nand block blood flow through the artery.

Common types of abuse \\ninclude:1 For more information about elder abuse definitions please seeElder Abuse \\nSurveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Core Data Elements. The older adult \\npopulation is growing faster in the U.S. than are younger populations. The data \\nunderestimate the problem because the number of nonfatal injuries is limited to older \\nadults who are treated in emergency departments. The information doesn?t include those \\ntreated by other providers or those that do not need or do not seek treatment. Additionally, \\nmany cases are not reported because the older adult is afraid or unable to tell police, \\nfriends, or family about the violence. Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is \\nexperienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home.2From 2002 to 2016, more than \\n643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and \\nover 19,000 homicides occurred.3 Compared with women, men had higher rates of both \\nnonfatal assaults and homicides.34The rate for nonfatal assaults increased more than 75% \\namong men (2002?2016) and more than 35% among women (2007?2016).

A \\nrecent CDC study found that assault injuries to older adults in the United States cost almost \\n$33 billion in 2022. This reflects a rise in both homicides and nonfatal assaults treated in \\nemergency departments among older adults. Specifically, the rate of nonfatal assaults \\nincreased by 31%, while the rate of homicides rose by 26% between 2015 and 2022.5 \\nAbuse can have several physical and emotional effects on an older adult. Victims are fearful \\nand anxious. They may have problems with trust and be wary of others.6 Many victims \\nsuffer physical injuries. Some are minor, like cuts, scratches, bruises, and welts. Others are \\nmore serious and can cause lasting disabilities. These include head injuries, broken bones, \\nconstant physical pain, and soreness.

It is an important source of nitrogen, which \\nis needed by plants and animals. It is widely used in fertilizers and pharmaceuticals. At \\nroom temperature, ammonia is a clear, colorless gas. Ammonia can also be a clear, colorless \\nliquid that dissolves in water. Changing ammonia to a liquid can help with its storage and \\ntransportation. Ammonia can be recognized by its strong smell, which is like the smell of \\nrotting fish. Ammonia reacts with strong oxidizers, acids, halogens (including chlorine \\nbleach), and salts of silver, zinc, copper, and other heavy metals. Ammonia is also commonly \\nused in a liquid form mixed with water, such as household ammonia. Normal amounts of \\nammonia in the environment do not cause health effects in humans. Exposure to high levels \\nof ammonia may hurt your skin, eyes, throat, and lungs and cause coughing and burns. Lung \\ndamage and death may occur after exposure to very high levels of ammonia. Most people \\nwill smell the chemical or feel irritation that tells you that you are exposed to ammonia. \\nExposure for a long time may affect people's ability to sense the chemical. Effects depend on \\nhow the person was exposed, how much they were exposed to, and how long they were \\nexposed for. Some people with asthma or other chronic lung diseases may be more sensitive \\nto breathing ammonia than others. Symptoms of exposure to higher levels of ammonia \\ninclude the following: Exposure to very high levels of ammonia can lead to death. If \\nammonia is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in \\nthe gas. \\nAmmonia gas is lighter than air, so it will rise. \\nIf ammonia is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains \\nammonia. Ammonia is unlikely to be eaten or drunk, because it has a very bad smell and \\ntaste. Avoid using or eating food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that \\nmay have touched liquid ammonia if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food \\nis in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by an ammonia \\nrelease. Wash the outside of the container before using. Follow any directions by local \\nauthorities. Get awayfrom the area where the ammonia was released and breathe fresh air. \\nIf the ammonia release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows \\nare closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the ammonia does not come \\ninside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the ammonia was released. If the \\nammonia release was indoors, get out of the building. If the ammonia release was from \\nhousehold cleaners or chemicals, open windows and doors to let in fresh air. Leave the area \\nuntil the gas has gone away. If you cannot get away, go to the lowest ground possible \\nbecause ammonia is lighter than air and will rise.

Do not use eye drops. Dry your face, then tilt your head back \\nand dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop \\nused things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low \\nbody temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.

Remove gloves and put them in \\nthe plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second \\nbag also. Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other \\npeople are unlikely to disturb them and touch ammonia. Inform local authorities of the \\nlocation of the bags for pick up. No known cure exists for ammonia exposure. Treatment \\ninvolves removing ammonia from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive \\nmedical care. Symptoms can be treated in a hospital setting or by trained emergency \\npersonnel. If someone has swallowed ammonia, do not force vomiting. While most people \\nrecover, survivors who breathed in large amounts may suffer long-term lung damage. If \\nammonia touches your eyes, it may cause ulcerations (sores) and perforations (holes) to \\nform in the eye. This can occur up to weeks or months after exposure and could lead to \\nblindness. Cataracts (cloudiness in the eyes) and glaucoma (disease that damages the eye) \\nhave also been reported after ammonia exposure.

Below \\nis a list of diseases that reptiles and amphibians can spread. Before buying or adopting a pet \\nreptile or amphibian, make sure it is the right type of pet for your family. Some reptiles can \\nlive for a very long time. Reptiles and amphibians require special care and are more likely \\nthan other pets to carry germs that make people sick, likeSalmonella, even when they \\nappear clean and healthy. Wash your handswith soap and running water: Use hand sanitizer \\nwith at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available. Supervise young \\nchildren when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol. Children younger \\nthan 5 years old should not handle or touch reptiles or amphibians or their environments \\nbecause they are at a higher risk for serious illness and hospitalization caused bySalmonella \\ninfection. You don't have to touch a reptile or amphibian to get sick from the germs they \\ncarry. Reptile food, tank water, equipment, and habitats can be contaminated \\nwithSalmonellaand other germs. Keep reptiles, amphibians, and their equipment out of the \\nkitchen or anywhere that food is prepared, stored, served, or eaten. \\nDon't allow reptiles or amphibians to roam freely throughout a home or living area. \\nSupervise your pet when outside of its habitat to prevent accidents and contamination. Use \\na designated container for storing and thawing frozen food for your pet. Keep the pet food \\naway from human food. Wash your hands and clean the container immediately after feeding \\npet reptiles and amphibians. Frozen or live rodents used for pet food, also called feeder \\nrodents, can carry germs that can make people sick. This can happen even if the rodent \\nlooks healthy and clean. Freezing feeder rodents does not kill germs. Always wash your \\nhands after handling live or frozen rodents or touching anything they came in contact with. \\nClean and disinfect all surfaces and supplies that come in contact with rodents. Rodents can \\ncontaminate surfaces where they are thawed or anything they touch. You can get sick by \\ntouching contaminated surfaces; you don't have to touch the rodents to get sick from their \\ngerms. Keep rodents and their supplies out of the kitchen or other areas where food is \\nprepared, served, or consumed. Never use the kitchen sink or food preparation areas to \\nthaw frozen rodents or to clean live rodent habitats. Do not thaw frozen rodents in the \\nmicrowave.

Not all reptiles and amphibians have teeth, but even those who \\ndon't (like most turtles) can still have painful bites. Bites from reptiles and amphibians can \\nbe dangerous because they can spread germs and sometimes other toxic substances, \\ndepending on the type of animal. Bites and scratches can be serious injuries and sometimes \\ncan become infected. Don't kiss or hold reptiles or amphibians close to your face, as this \\nmight frighten them and increase your chances of being bitten. Make sure the animal sees \\nyou before you pick it up. If an animal is surprised, they might bite out of fear. Feed your \\nreptile with tongs. Don't give them food from your hand. \\nHandle your pet often so they become used to being held. If you only handle your pet to feed \\nthem, they might learn to associate a hand with food. What to do if you are bitten or \\nscratched Seek medical attention, especially if: If the animal becomes sick or dies after \\nbiting a person, let your veterinarian know within a few days to a week. They can determine \\nwhether the animal might have had germs that could spread to people. CDC does not \\nrecommend keeping venomous animals as pets or in household settings. Venoms are a \\ndefense that some reptiles and amphibians use to protect themselves from any potential \\ndangers or harm in their environment. Some venomous animals, like poison dart frogs and \\ncoral snakes, can be identified by their bright colors and markings. However, some \\nvenomous animals are harder to identify. Some animals can transmit venoms through bites \\nor through contact with their skin or saliva. You should always consider the unpredictable \\nnature of venomous animals and be aware that treating a bite from a venomous animal is \\ndifficult. Venoms are very toxic and can have severe and life-threatening effects. \\nAntivenoms can treat some bites, but these medications can cost hundreds of dollars and \\nmight not be available at some hospitals. In addition, antivenom sometimes can cause \\nallergic reactions that can be just as dangerous as the venom itself. If you keep or work with \\nvenomous animals, make a list of all the hospitals in your area that stock antivenoms for \\nthose types of animals. Include hospital phone numbers and addresses. Put this list \\nsomewhere easy to find, like on your refrigerator or near the animal's habitat. Call your \\nhealthcare provider as soon as possible so that they can prepare the appropriate antivenom. \\nBe as clear as possible about the type, colors, and markings of the animal. Correct \\nidentification of the animal helps healthcare providers to provide the appropriate \\ntreatment. Don't handle or trap the animal, because venom can be dangerous even after the \\nanimal has died. \\nRemain as calm and still as possible until you can be treated by a healthcare provider. \\nApplyfirst aid: Think about the people in your household.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that \\nlives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist \\nclimates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical \\ndiseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected \\npopulations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and \\neffective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in \\nthe affected communities. Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's \\nintestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when \\ninfected people defecate (poop) outside, useunimproved sanitation facilities(when there is \\nno sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as \\nfertilizer. Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites \\nglobally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. \\nThey may occur in temperate climates during warmer months. People who consume soil \\nwithAscarisor whipworm eggs in it can become infected with \\ntheAscarisorwhipwormparasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are: Ascarisand \\nwhipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil. People with only a few worms \\n(light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can \\ncause a range of health problems, including To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted \\nhelminth infections Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it \\nfor a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope. Only prescription drugs can \\ntreat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and \\nmebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and \\nthree days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm.

It is also called \\nthe rat lungworm. The adult form of the parasite is found only in rodents. Infected rats pass \\nlarvae of the parasite in their feces. Snails and slugs get infected by ingesting the larvae. \\nThese larvae mature in snails and slugs but do not become adult worms. The life cycle is \\ncompleted when rats eat infected snails or slugs and the larvae further mature to become \\nadult worms. Angiostrongylus cantonensis,which is also known as the rat lungworm, causes \\neosinophilic meningitis and is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands. The \\nrecognized distribution of the parasite has been increasing over time and infections have \\nbeen identified in other areas, including Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. \\nAngiostrongylus costaricensiscauses eosinophilic gastroenteritis and is found in Latin \\nAmerica and the Caribbean. Some infected people don?t have any symptoms?or have only \\nmild symptoms that don?t last very long. Sometimes the infection causes a rare type of \\nmeningitis (eosinophilic meningitis). The symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, \\ntingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting. People can get \\ninfected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite. In \\nsome cultures, snails are commonly eaten. Some children, in particular, have gotten infected \\nby swallowing snails/slugs \"on a dare. \" People also can get infected by accident, by eating \\nraw produce (such as lettuce) that contains a small snail or slug or part of one. Certain \\nanimals such freshwater shrimp, crabs, or frogs, have been found to be infected with larvae \\nof the parasite. African land snails, which can grow larger than a person?s hand, is just one \\nof many types that can be infected. But snails can be infected only if they have ingested \\ncontaminated rat feces. It is possible that eating undercooked or raw animals that are \\ninfected could result in people becoming infected, though the evidence for this is not as \\nclear as for eating infected snails and slugs. Of note, fish do not spread this parasite. This \\nvideo illustrates how people get infected withA. cantonensisor rat lungworm.  Don?t eat raw \\nor undercooked snails or slugs, frogs or shrimp/prawns. If you handle snails or slugs, wear \\ngloves and wash your hands. Always remember to thoroughly wash fresh produce. When \\ntravelling in areas where the parasite is common, avoid eating uncooked vegetables.

It's found naturally in soil around the world and commonly affects \\nlivestock and wild animals. People usually get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with \\ninfected animals or contaminated animal products. People can breathe in anthrax spores, \\neat food or drink water contaminated with spores, or get spores in a cut or scrape in the \\nskin. Livestock and wild animals can become infected when they breathe in, eat, or drink \\nspores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. These animals can include cattle, sheep, goats, \\nantelope, and deer. Anthrax is rare in the United States. However, occasional outbreaks do \\nhappen in wild and domestic grazing animals such as cattle or deer. In the United States, \\nveterinarians recommend yearly vaccination of livestock in areas where animals have had \\nanthrax in the past. Most people will never be exposed to anthrax. However, there arejobs, \\nhobbies, and activitiesthat can put some people at higher risk of exposure. The type of \\nillness a person develops depends on how anthrax enters the body: through the skin, lungs, \\nor gastrointestinal system. All types of anthrax can cause death if they're not treated with \\nantibiotics. There are four types of anthrax: Cutaneous anthraxhappens when anthrax \\nspores get into a cut or scape on the skin when a person handles infected animals or \\ncontaminated animal products like wool, hides, or hair.  It mostly shows up on the head, \\nneck, forearms, and hands. It's the most common form of anthrax infection, and it's also \\nconsidered to be the least dangerous. Recently,injection anthraxwas identified in heroin-\\ninjecting drug users in northern Europe, but it hasn't been reported in the United States. \\nInjection anthrax is similar to cutaneous anthrax and causes infection deep under the skin \\nor in the muscle where the drug was injected. Inhalation anthraxhappens when a person \\nbreathes in anthrax spores. It's the deadliest form of the disease. People who work in places \\nsuch as wool mills, slaughterhouses, and tanneries may breathe in the spores when working \\nwith infected animals or contaminated animal products. Inhalation anthrax starts primarily \\nin the lymph nodes in the chest before spreading throughout the rest of the body. \\nGastrointestinal anthraxhappens when a person eats raw or undercooked meat from an \\ninfected animal.

The reservoir can spread the \\nvirus to people through infected urine, saliva, or droppings, and can cause severe disease in \\npeople. People are infected with arenaviruses by: Viruses in the Bunyavirales order are \\nspread by rodents or insects, such as mosquitos, ticks, or sand flies. They can produce mild \\nto severe disease in animals and people. Many of these viruses cannot spread between \\npeople. However, person-to-person spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has \\noccurred in healthcare settings where infection control was limited. Filoviruses can cause \\nsevere illness in people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and gorillas). The \\nEgyptian rousette bat,Rousettus aegyptiacus,is a cave-dwelling bat, and the reservoir for \\nMarburg virus. Bats infected with orthomarburgviruses do not show obvious signs of \\nillness. It's not known what animal carries ebolaviruses in nature but scientists suspect that \\nbats are likely involved. Once filoviruses are introduced into the human population, they \\ncan spread between people through contact with an infected person's body fluids. \\nCaretakers and healthcare providers who do not use appropriate personal protective \\nequipment (PPE) are at higher risk of infection. Flaviviruses, are found throughout the \\nworld. These viruses, which are primarily spread by mosquitoes and ticks, can cause mild to \\nsevere disease or even death. They can also cause disease in animals, creating a large \\neconomic and social impact on people living in affected areas. Paramyxoviruses can cause \\nsudden onset of respiratory disease. While there are many viruses included within \\ntheParamyxoviridaefamily, Hendra and Nipah viruses are considered more serious because \\nthey require a specialized lab (biosafety level 4 lab) and can cause serious disease, spread \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 41, 'page_label': '124'}, page_content='between animals and people , and have no vaccine or treatment currently available.      \\nLikely bats, (species unknown)  Prevention of VHFs and other HCIDs depends on the host \\nreservoir and how the virus spreads. Prevention measures can target reservoir exclusion \\nactivities (for example, use of insect repellents, bed nets, and protective clothing and \\ndisinfection procedures while caring for a sick person) or by sealing up and setting traps in \\nhomes and other buildings when a rodent infestation is discovered.

Arsine is formed when arsenic comes in contact with an acid. Arsine is similar to \\na gas called stibine, which is formed when the metal antimony comes in contact with an \\nacid. Stibine has health effects similar to those of arsine, but it is not as widely available. \\nStibine also has a noticeable \"rotten egg\" smell. Arsine is most commonly used in the \\nsemiconductor and metals refining industries. Arsine was studied as a warfare agent during \\nWorld War II, but it was never used on the battlefield. After arsine enters the bloodstream, \\nit damages the red blood cells. This can lead to symptoms of hemolytic anemia, when red \\nblood cells die faster than the body can replace them. The effects of arsine poisoning depend \\non how much arsine a person was exposed to and how long the exposure was. Depending \\non the level of exposure to arsine, symptoms are likely to occur within the first 24 hours \\nafter exposure. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person \\nhas been exposed to arsine. Breathing in the gas is the most likely way of exposure after \\narsine is released into the air. Arsine is not absorbed into the body through the eyes and the \\nskin. At lower amounts, people may not know they have been exposed to arsine, because it \\nhas no smell.

On the other hand, stibine has a strong smell, so people may notice that they may \\nhave been exposed. Most reports of exposure are when arsine is accidentally made in the \\nworkplace. Arsine gas is heavier than air, so it would be more likely to settle in lower areas. \\nBecause there is no cure for arsine exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it. First,get fresh \\nairby leaving the area where the arsine is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to \\nreduce the possibility of death from arsine. If arsine was released outside, move away from \\nthe area. \\nIf arsine was released indoors, get out of the building. If you are near an arsine release, \\nemergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or \"shelter in place\" inside.

It is one of the most common long-term diseases among \\nchildren, but adults can have asthma, too. Asthma attacks occur when the lung airways \\ntighten due to inflammation. Asthma attacks can be caused by \"triggers\" such as respiratory \\ninfections, allergy particles, chemical irritants, and air pollution. During an asthma attack, a \\nperson with asthma can experience symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest \\ntightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing. Often, asthma attacks can be prevented \\nby limiting one\\'s exposure to triggers and by properly using asthma medications. People \\nwith asthma can develop swollen and sensitive airways, and flu can cause further \\ninflammation of the airways and lungs. Flu can trigger asthma attacks and cause worsening \\nof asthma symptoms. Flu also can lead to pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases. \\nIn fact, adults and children with asthma are more likely to develop pneumonia after getting \\nsick with flu than people who do not have asthma. Asthma is the most common medical \\ncondition among children hospitalized with flu and one of the more common medical \\nconditions among adults hospitalized with flu.

To control \\nit, avoid triggers that cause asthma symptoms and take prescribed medicine. Many triggers \\ncan be in the workplace. Over 300 known substances in the workplace can cause or worsen \\nasthma. Avoiding triggers can prevent asthma from getting worse. Worsening asthma or \\nnew onset asthma in a worker should raise questions about workplace causes. Asthma \\nsymptoms can develop shortly after exposure. However, they can also develop months or \\nyears after repeated exposures to harmful substances. Symptoms of work-related asthma \\nare the same as symptoms for non-work-related asthma. They include: Asthma symptoms \\ncan come and go, and some workers might not have all of the symptoms. Workers can get \\nwork-related asthma even when using personal protective equipment such as respirators or \\nface masks. Sometimes breathing problems start at work and continue after leaving work \\nwhen exposure has stopped. Symptoms for work-related asthma tend to get better on \\nweekends, vacations, or other times when away from work. However, in some cases, \\nsymptoms do not improve until extended time away from exposures or triggers. Your \\ndoctor can diagnose work-related asthma. Tell your doctor about work exposures and \\npossible triggers including your job, tasks, and materials you use. Also consider recording \\nwhen and where your symptoms occur to help determine any patterns. Your doctor will ask \\nquestions about your symptoms and will conduct a physical examination.

An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too \\nslowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the \\nupper chambers of the heart (the two atria) is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it \\nshould from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart (the two ventricles). AFib may \\nhappen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. Some people who have AFib \\ndon't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more \\nof the following symptoms: The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the \\nrisk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib.4 \\nRisk factors for AFib include:45 AFib increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard \\nstroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold \\nincreased risk of ischemic stroke.6AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes.7 Strokes caused by \\ncomplications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. \\nStrokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits \\ncalled plaque in the blood vessel lining. Treatment for AFib can include: More than 454,000 \\nhospitalizations with AFib as the primary diagnosis happen each year in the US.4The \\ncondition contributes to about 158,000 deaths each year.3The death rate from AFib as the \\nprimary or a contributing cause of death has been rising for more than two decades.7 Heart \\ndisease is the leading cause of death in the United States.

Two types of mercury to which people may be exposed ? \\nmethylmercury and ethylmercury ? are very different. Methylmercury is the type of \\nmercury found in certain kinds of fish. At high exposure levels methylmercury can be toxic \\nto people. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible \\nout of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some \\nmethylmercury. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body \\nmore quickly than methylmercury, and is therefore less likely to cause any harm. \\nThimerosal is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose (multi-dose vials) \\nto prevent growth of germs, like bacteria and fungi. Introduction of bacteria and fungi has \\nthe potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for \\nadministration. Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, \\nserious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added \\nduring the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth. Thimerosal was taken out of \\nchildhood vaccines in the United States in 2001. For a complete list of vaccines and their \\nthimerosal content level, see the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Thimerosal in \\nVaccinespage. Thimerosal use in medical products has a record of being very safe. Data from \\nmany studies show no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in \\nvaccines.123456 The most common side-effects of thimerosal in vaccines are minor \\nreactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. Although rare, some people may be \\nallergic to thimerosal. Research does not show any link between thimerosal in vaccines \\nandautism, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Many well conducted studies have concluded \\nthat thimerosal in vaccines does not contribute to the development of autism.135Even after \\nthimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to \\nincrease, which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism. A \\n2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown that \\nprenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal does \\nnot increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).1 Studies have assessed the possible \\nassociation between ethyl mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing vaccines and \\nneuropsychological functioning including an objective measurement of neuropsychological \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 52, 'page_label': '135'}, page_content='functioning.

Scientists have been studying the use of thimerosal in vaccines for many \\nyears. They haven?t found any evidence that thimerosal causes harm. No. Thimerosal hasn't \\nbeen used in vaccines for children since 2001. However, thimerosal is still used insome flu \\nvaccines. Yearly flu vaccines are recommended for all children. If you are worried about \\nthimerosal, you can ask for a flu vaccine without it. No. Research does not show any link \\nbetween thimerosal and autism.

However, it can lead to severe \\nbrain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately. People typically get infected \\nwith B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey; or have contact \\nwith the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth. Symptoms typically start within one month of \\nbeing exposed to B virus. However, they could appear in as little as 3 to 7 days. The first \\nindications of B virus infection are typically flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills. Then, \\nyou may develop small blisters in the wound or area on your body that had contact with the \\nmonkey. As the disease progresses, the virus spreads to and causes inflammation (swelling) \\nof the brain and spinal cord. Problems with breathing and death can occur one day to three \\nweeks after symptoms appear. Most people will not come in contact with monkeys, so their \\nrisk of getting infected with B virus is very low. However, laboratory workers, veterinarians, \\nand people more likely exposed to macaque monkeys have a higher risk of getting B virus \\ninfection. B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people. You can get \\ninfected with B virus if you: There are no vaccines that can protect you against B virus \\ninfection. If you are in a place with macaque monkeys, stay away from them so that you \\ndon't get bitten or scratched. You should not touch or feed monkeys.

If your healthcare provider determines that you need treatment for B virus \\nexposure or infection, you may be given antiviral medications. Timely first aid and \\ntreatment for high-risk exposures is crucial to preventing life-threatening disease. Macaque \\nmonkeys housed in primate facilities usually become infected with B virus by the time they \\nreach adulthood. However, even when they are infected with B virus, monkeys typically do \\nnot have symptoms, or have just mild disease. B virus can spread from infected macaque \\nmonkeys to people.

They first found influenza A in bats in little yellow-shouldered bats.1 Bat \\ninfluenza viruses have since been detected in some other species of bats in Central and \\nSouth America.2 The discovery of bat influenza viruses is important for public health \\nbecause bats represent a new animal species that may act as a source of influenza viruses. \\nInfluenza viruses are already known to spread and cause disease in other animals. \\nLaboratory research conducted at CDC and elsewhere suggests that bat influenza viruses \\nwould need to change significantly to be able to infect and spread easily among humans. \\nCDC laboratory research suggests bat influenza viruses would need to undergo significant \\nchanges to become capable of infecting and spreading easily among people. Therefore, these \\nviruses do not appear to pose a risk to human health in their current form. However, CDC \\nscientists cannot rule out the possibility that these viruses could eventually become capable \\nof infecting humans. The internal genes of bat influenza viruses are compatible with human \\ninfluenza viruses. That means it is possible that these viruses could exchange genetic \\ninformation with human influenza viruses through a process called \"reassortment.\" \\nReassortment occurs when two or more influenza viruses infect a single host cell, which \\nallows the viruses to swap genetic information. The conditions needed for reassortment \\nbetween human influenza viruses and bat influenza viruses remain unknown. A different \\nanimal (such as pigs, horses, dogs, or seals) would need to serve as a \"bridge.\" That means \\nthat another animal would need to be capable of being infected with both bat influenza \\nvirus and human influenza viruses for reassortment to occur. Since the discovery of bat flu, \\nthere has been at least one study to assess the possibility of reassortment events occurring \\nbetween bat influenza and other influenza viruses.3 So far, the results of these studies \\ncontinue to indicate that bat influenza viruses are very unlikely to reassort with other \\ninfluenza viruses. Preliminary laboratory research at CDC suggests that human cells do not \\nsupport growth of bat influenza viruses.1 The bat influenza viruses discovered in Central \\nand South America are very different from other influenza viruses in humans and animals. \\nAll influenza A viruses have hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins. Until the discovery of bat \\ninfluenza viruses, there were only 16 different classes (or ?subtypes?) of HA proteins \\nknown to exist in nature. The new bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 65, 'page_label': '148'}, page_content='are distinct from pre-existing subtypes. CDC scientists have classified them as new \\nsubtypes, denoted as ?H17? and ?H18.?12 The other surface protein-coding gene of bat \\ninfluenza viruses, neuraminidase (NA), is different from that of known influenza viruses, as \\nwell. CDC scientists have proposed new designations for the NA subtypes found in bats: \\n?N10? and ?N11.? The discovery of bat flu has shed light on the evolution of influenza A, B, \\nand C viruses. It is possible that many of the internal genes of bat influenza viruses are \\ndescendants of influenza virus families that once circulated more widely in previous \\ncenturies and that are now extinct, or yet to be discovered. Using a process called \\nphylogenic analysis, comparisons between different bat influenza viruses found in Central \\nand South America have shown that there is considerable genetic diversity between them. \\nSome researchers concluded that in Central and South American bat populations, the bat \\ninfluenza viruses may have as much genetic diversity as those found in the influenza viruses \\nof all other mammal and bird species combined. These conclusions suggest that bat \\ninfluenza viruses have been evolving in bats over a very long time, potentially centuries.2 \\nThe discovery of the bat influenza viruses was made possible by field work conducted by \\nthe following: A total of 316 healthy bats from 21 different species were captured from \\neight locations in southern Guatemala during 2009 and 2010. Rectal swabs and tissues were \\ncollected from each of the bats. Videos showing how specimens are collected from bats in \\nGuatemala are available:\"Global Disease Detectives\"and\"CDC Global Disease Detectives: \\nClues From a Bat Cave.\" Swabs that were negative for rabies were analyzed by the Pathogen \\nDiscovery Program in CDC\\'s Division of Viral Diseases to detect other pathogenic viruses. \\nInitial viral screening determined that 3 of the 316 bats tested positive for influenza. All \\nwere from a single species known as little yellow-shouldered bats. The Pathogen Discovery \\nProgram was able to identify and sequence the complete genome of the new viruses using \\nhigh-throughput sequencing instruments in the laboratory. Influenza A viruses are found in \\nmany different animals, including ducks, chickens, pigs, whales, horses, seals and cats. \\nInfluenza B viruses are only found in humans.

If \\nyou think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare \\nprovider. Everyone is at risk for getting bed bugs when visiting an infested area. However, \\nyou are at higher risk of getting bed bugs if you travel frequently and share living and \\nsleeping space where other people have previously slept. Bed bugs are experts at hiding. \\nTheir slim flat bodies allow them to fit into very small spaces. They can go long periods of \\ntime without a blood meal. Bed bugs spread by getting into the seams and folds of luggage, \\novernight bags, folded clothes, bedding, furniture, and anywhere else they can hide.

For \\nthose that travel, it may be helpful to look for signs of infestation, such as exoskeletons or \\nbed bugs in folds of mattresses and sheets, in sleeping areas. Bed bug infestations usually \\nhappen around or near areas where people sleep. This includes apartments, shelters, \\nhouses, hotels, cruise ships, buses, trains, and dorm rooms. The bugs hide during the day in \\nplaces on or around the bed. They can hide in Bed bugs can travel over 100 feet in a night \\nbut tend to live within 8 feet of where people sleep. One of the easiest ways to identify a bed \\nbug infestation is by bite marks on the face, neck, arms, hands, or any other body parts after \\nsleeping. However, these bite marks may take as long as 14 days to develop in some people. \\nIt's important to look for other clues to determine if you have an infestation.

The best way to treat a bite is to apply antiseptic creams or lotions to \\nhelp with itching and to avoid scratching the area (to prevent secondary infections). For \\npeople with itchy inflammatory reactions, an antihistamine may help control the itching. If \\nyou think you have a bed bug infestation, contact a professional pest control company \\nexperienced with treating bed bugs.

It is also a natural part of crude oil, \\ngasoline, and cigarette smoke. Benzene is used often in the United States. It is in the top 20 \\nproduced chemicals by quantity. \\nSome industries use benzene to make other chemicals that are used to make plastics, resins, \\nand nylon and synthetic fibers. It is also used to make: Benzene works by causing cells not \\nto work correctly. For example, it can cause bone marrow not to produce enough red blood \\ncells. This can lead to anemia. It can also hurt the immune system by changing blood levels \\nof antibodies and causing the loss of white blood cells. The level of benzene poisoning \\ndepends on the amount, how someone was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on \\nthe person's age and medical conditions they may have. These signs and symptoms may \\nshow up within minutes to several hours. Showing these signs and symptoms does not \\nnecessarily mean that a person has been exposed to benzene. If a person vomits because \\nthey ate or drank something with benzene, the vomit could be sucked into the lungs. This \\ncan cause breathing problems and coughing. If benzene touches the eyes, skin, or lungs, it \\ncan cause injury and irritation. People working in jobs that make or use benzene may be \\nexposed to the highest levels of it. Low levels of benzene can be found at: The air around \\nhazardous waste sites or gas stations can contain higher levels of benzene than in other \\nareas. Benzene leaks from underground storage tanks or from hazardous waste sites \\ncontaining benzene can contaminate well water. Indoor air generally contains levels of \\nbenzene higher than those in outdoor air. It can come from products such as: Get fresh air \\nby leaving the area where the benzene is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to \\nreduce the possibility of death from benzene. If benzene was released outside, move away \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 69, 'page_label': '152'}, page_content='from the area. If benzene was released indoors, get out of the building. If you swallowed \\nbenzene, do not induce vomiting or drink fluids. Get medical attention right away.  If you \\nthink you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as \\nquickly as possible. Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of \\npulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas. Wash any \\nbenzene from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will \\nprotect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is \\nblurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove \\nthem and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if \\nthey are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. \\nYou can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. After you have washed yourself, \\nplace your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you \\nhave to touch unsafe areas, or you aren\\'t sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber \\ngloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in \\nthe bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you \\nwear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside \\nanother plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others \\nfrom any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When the local or state health \\ndepartment or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health \\ndepartment or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic \\nbags yourself. For more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your \\nclothes after a chemical exposure, visit \"About Getting Clean.\" If you are near a benzene \\nrelease, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or \"shelter in place\" inside. For \\nmore information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, visit \"Responding to \\nEvacuation.\" For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, visit \\n\"Responding to Sheltering in Place.\" The most important thing is for people toseek medical \\ntreatment as soon as possible. No cure exists for benzene poisoning. Benzene poisoning is \\ntreated with supportive medical care in a hospital. Long-term exposure, or exposure of a \\nyear or more, to benzene can affect the blood. Benzene causes harmful effects on bone \\nmarrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anemia. It can also cause \\nexcessive bleeding and affect the immune system, increasing the chance for infection. \\nStudies in animals show low birth weights, bones being formed late, and bone marrow \\ndamage when pregnant animals breathed benzene. The Department of Health and Human \\nServices (DHHS) has said that benzene causes cancer in humans. Long-term exposure to \\nhigh levels of benzene in the air can cause leukemia, a blood-related cancer. Some women \\nwho breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods. \\nSome women also had a decrease in the size of their ovaries. It is not known whether \\nbenzene exposure affects the developing fetus in pregnant women or fertility in men.

Body lice \\ncan spread disease. They live and lay eggs on clothing and bedding used by infested people. \\nAdult body lice are small, only 2.3 ? 3.6 mm in length (about the size of a sesame seed). \\nImproved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only treatment \\nneeded for body lice infestations; however, in some cases peduculicides are recommended. \\nBody lice can spread disease (epidemic typhus,Bartonella quintana infection, andepidemic \\nrelapsing fever). Intense itching (pruritus) and rash caused by an allergic reaction to louse \\nbites are common symptoms of body lice infestation. As with other lice infestations, intense \\nitching leads to scratching which can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection of the \\nskin. When body lice infestation lasts long, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become \\nthickened and darkened, particularly in the mid-section of the body (waist, groin, upper \\nthighs). Body lice exist worldwide but usually affect people who live in crowded conditions. \\nThey affect people without access to regular bathing and clean clothes. They can spread \\nquickly in: Body lice spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice. They \\ncan also spread through contact with clothing, beds, or linens that have been in contact with \\na person infested with lice. However, in the United States, actual infestation with body lice \\ntends to occur only in people who do not have access to housing, regular bathing, or clean \\nclothes. Nits (lice eggs) take 6 ? 9 days to hatch. Nits are tiny (0.8 ? 0.3 mm) and hard to see; \\nthey can be confused for dandruff. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) are about the size of a \\npinhead and take about a week to grow into adults. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame \\nseed, have six legs, and are tan to grayish white. Adult females can lay up to eight nits per \\nday. Adult lice need to feed on blood several times each day; without blood meals, the louse \\nwill die within 1 ? 2 days off the host. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice. \\nTake these steps to help prevent and control the spread of body lice: You can diagnose body \\nlice infestation by finding eggs and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes you \\ncan see a body louse crawling or feeding on the skin. Although body lice and nits can be \\nlarge enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or \\neggs. See a healthcare provider if you are unsure about an infestation. You can treat a body \\nlice infestation by improving personal hygiene. Bathe and change into clean clothes at least \\nonce a week. Wash clothing, bedding, and towels used by the person infested with lice using \\nhot water (at least 130°F) and machine dry using the hot cycle. Pediculicide, a medicine that \\ncan kill lice, is sometimes used for treatment. If prescribed a pediculicide, apply it exactly as \\ndirected on the bottle or by your healthcare provider. However, a pediculicide is generally \\nnot necessary if hygiene is maintained and items are machine washed appropriately at least '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 78, 'page_label': '161'}, page_content=\"once a week.

Botulism causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, \\nand even death. The toxin is made byClostridium botulinumand sometimesClostridium \\nbutyricumandClostridium baratiibacteria (germs). These bacteria can produce the toxin in \\nfood, wounds, and the intestines of infants. The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are \\nfound naturally in many places, but it\\'s rare for them to make people sick. These bacteria \\nmake spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the \\nenvironment, even in extreme conditions. The spores usually do not cause people to become \\nsick, even when they\\'re eaten. But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and \\nmake one of the most lethal toxins known. The conditions in which the spores can grow and \\nmake toxin are: For example, improperlyhome-canned, preserved, or fermented foodscan \\nprovide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. When people eat \\nthese foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don\\'t get proper medical \\ntreatment quickly. There are 5 main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism can happen by \\neating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of \\nfoodborne botulism arehomemade foodsthat have been improperly canned, preserved, or \\nfermented. Though uncommon, store-bought foods also can be contaminated with \\nbotulinum toxin. Wound botulism can happen if the spores get into a wound and make a \\ntoxin.People who inject illicit drugshave a greater chance of getting wound botulism. People \\nwho have had a traumatic injury, such as a motorcycle crash, or surgery also can get wound \\nbotulism. For reasons we do not understand, some infants get botulism when the spores get \\ninto their intestines, grow, and produce the toxin. Iatrogenic botulism can happen if too \\nmuch botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as for wrinkles. It also can \\nhappen if too much of the toxin is injected for medical reasons, such as for migraine \\nheadaches. Adult intestinal toxemia is also known as adult intestinal colonization. This kind \\nof botulism is a very rare. It can happen if the spores of the bacteria get into an adult\\'s \\nintestines, grow, and produce the toxin (similar to infant botulism). We don\\'t know why \\npeople get this kind of botulism. People with a serious health condition affecting the gut \\nmight be more likely to get ill.

BSE caused a major outbreak in the 1980-90s, with cases \\nreported in at least 24 countries. Most cases occurred in the United Kingdom, but many \\nother countries also reported cases. Changes to feed policies have made BSE extremely rare \\nnow. However, animal health officials continue to monitor suspicious deaths in cows to \\nwatch for a potential BSE recurrence. BSE is caused by a prion, an infectious protein. Prions \\nare misfolded forms of proteins normally found in the bodies of animals and people. It \\ntypically takes years for symptoms to begin after an animal is infected with a prion. \\nScientists believe BSE may have been caused by feeding cattle meat-and-bone meal that \\ncontained prion-infected products from cows or sheep. There is strong evidence the BSE \\noutbreak grew and spread throughout the U.K. when such infected feed was given to young \\ncalves. The first two cases of BSE were identified in cows in 1986 in the United Kingdom. \\nThe cows were likely infected in the 1970s. The U.K. quickly became the epicenter of the \\noutbreak. Overall, more than 184,000 cows in the U.K. died from BSE between 1986 and \\n2015. The outbreak was widespread, with more than 35,000 U.K. herds affected. Cases \\npeaked in 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week. Cases deceased drastically after control \\nmeasures were implemented. BSE cases are still reported occasionally but are very rare. \\nOutside the U.K., BSE was first reported in Ireland in 1989 and Portugal and Switzerland in \\n1990. By 2005, the number of countries reporting BSE among native cattle increased to 24, \\nwith the majority in Europe. The first North American BSE case was reported in 1993 in a \\ncow imported into Canada from the UK. Rendered cohorts of this cow may have been \\nresponsible for 19 additional Canadian BSE cases beginning in 2003. In addition, animal \\nhealth officials have identified 6 BSE cases in cows in the United States. One was imported \\nfrom Canada and is believed to have been infected there. The others were diagnosed with \\natypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by \\ncontaminated feed. Animal health officials eventually determined BSE-infected cows had \\neaten feed made from other cows that died from prion disease. This led to feed bans in \\nmultiple countries, which drastically reduced the number of BSE cases reported. Early '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 83, 'page_label': '166'}, page_content=\"efforts to control the BSE outbreak focused on culling (killing) sick animals to prevent them \\nfrom entering the food chain. The UK implemented the most stringent control measure - \\nexcluding animals >30 months old from the human and animal food supplies. It also \\nincluded a ban on using meat from around the animals' spinal columns since prions affect \\nthe nervous system. The programs - along with bans in other countries - have prevented \\nadditional BSE outbreaks. Occasional cases still occur, but they are very rare. Strong \\nevidence exists that consuming meat from BSE-infected cows causesvariant Creutzfeldt-\\nJakob disease (vCJD)in people. vCJD cases began in the U.K. about 10 years after BSE-\\ncontaminated beef likely made its way for an extended period into food produced for \\npeople. This is consistent with the time between when someone is exposed to a prion \\ndisease and when they develop one themselves.

In very rare cases,Naegleria fowlerihas been \\nfound in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and other recreational venues. \\nThe ameba also has been found in tap water. If water containing the ameba goes up the nose \\nand to the brain, it can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis \\n(PAM). Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM. Nearly everyone \\nwho gets PAM dies from it. Between 1962 and 2023, there were 164 reported cases of PAM \\nin the United States. Only four have survived. Early symptoms of PAM can include headache, \\nfever, nausea, and vomiting. PAM progresses rapidly. Most people with PAM die within 1 to \\n18 days after symptoms begin. It usually leads to coma and death after 5 days. As PAM \\nprogresses, symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and \\nsurroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations. Brain infections caused byNaegleria \\nfowleriusually occur after someone goes swimming or diving in a lake, river, or other fresh \\nwater during summer months. Infections often happen when it's been hot for long periods, \\nresulting in higher water temperatures and lower water levels.

Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce \\nthe chances of negative health effects from bromine. If the bromine was released outdoors, \\nmove away from the area where the bromine was released. Go to the highest ground \\npossible, because bromine is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas. If bromine was \\nreleased indoors, get out of the building. If you swallowed bromine, do not force vomiting or \\ndrink fluids. Get medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. If \\nyou think you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as \\nquickly as possible. Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of \\npulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas. Wash any \\nbromine from your skin with lots of soap and water.

It does this by causing irritation to the \\neyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin. Several different compounds are riot control agents: \\nRiot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used \\nby individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray). \\nCS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use \\ntheir gas masks. Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for \\nexample, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure. The effects usually only last 15 to 30 \\nminutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off. The level of poisoning \\ndepends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how \\nlong. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors). People exposed \\nto riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately \\nafter exposure: Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects \\nsuch as: Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has \\nbeen exposed to riot control agents. Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or \\nsolids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets \\nor particles. If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin \\ncontact, eye contact, or breathing them in. Since breathing in riot control agents is the \\nprimary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where \\nfresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents.

As a group, cancers are very common. \\nGiven the frequency with which cancers are diagnosed, sometimes situations arise where an \\nunusual number of cancers are diagnosed among people in a particular location. These \\nunusual numbers may be from chance, or they may result from the following: Many causes \\nof cancer are unknown. However, some environmental exposures have been shown to be \\nrelated to the development of cancer in specific organs. For example, if you are exposed \\ntoasbestos, you could developmesothelioma. Some unusual patterns of cancer are \\nconsidered acancer cluster. A cancer cluster is defined as a greater than expected number of \\nthe same or etiologically related cancer cases that occurs within a group of people in a \\ngeographic area over a defined period of time. Etiology refers to causes and risk factors \\nassociated with the development of disease. For example, exposure to the sun can cause \\nskin cancer. The definition of a cancer cluster can be further explained as follows: A greater \\nthan expected number When the number of observed cases is greater than typically \\nobserved in a similar setting. Of the same or etiologically related cancer cases Cases are of \\nthe same type, are within a family of tumors (for exampleEwing's family of tumors) or have \\na known or suggested link to the same specific environmental or chemical exposures. It is \\npossible to consider multiple cancer types when such a known exposure (for example, \\nradiation or a specific chemical) is linked to more than one cancer type or when more than \\none contaminant or exposure type has been identified. Within a group of people The \\npopulation in which the cancer cases are occurring is defined by its demographic factors \\n(for example, race/ethnicity, age, and sex). In a geographic area The geographic area may be \\nbased upon pre-existing geopolitical boundaries (for example, census tract, county, or ZIP \\ncode/ZIP code tabulation area). It may be defined according to the nature and extent of \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 98, 'page_label': '181'}, page_content=\"potential exposures that may cross multiple or partial boundaries. For example, air \\npollution from a hazardous waste incinerator which may cross multiple counties or census \\ntracts. These geographic boundaries are used to determine the number of cancer cases as \\nthey relate to the total population in this predefined area. It is possible to create or obscure \\na cluster inadvertently by modifying the area of interest. Over a defined period of time The \\ntime frame used to establish the beginning and end dates for analysis. The time period \\nchosen for analysis will affect both the total cases observed and the calculation of the \\nexpected incidence of cancer in the population. If you suspect your community or \\nworkplace may be experiencing more cases of cancer than expected, or if you'd like \\ninformation such as cancer statistics or trends in your area, contact yourstate, tribal, local, \\nor territorial health departmentorstate/territory cancer registry.A state, tribal, local, or \\nterritorial health department provides the first response to reports of unusual patterns of \\ncancer. For information about cancer in the workplace, please see theNational Institute for \\nOccupational Safety and Healthwebsite. State, tribal, local, and territorial health \\ndepartments, along with cancer registries, respond to questions about unusual patterns of \\ncancer. Usually, health departments start by gathering information about the unusual \\npattern of cancer, including the expected cancer rate, types of cancer, number of cases, and \\nthe age, sex, race, address, occupation, and age at diagnosis of the people with cancer. \\nCDC/ATSDR has created adecision-making toolthat can be used by health departments for \\ndetermining the need to further assess an unusual pattern of cancer. The tool contains a set \\nof criteria that can be used to assess the cancer(s) of concern and/or related environmental \\nrisk factors. These criteria promote further assessment of unusual patterns of cancer. In \\ngeneral, cancers have a variety of risk factors related to behavioral, lifestyle, occupational, \\nand environmental risks. For many cancers, you can reduce your risk of developing cancer \\nby adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes avoiding tobacco use, excessive alcohol \\nconsumption, and sun exposure; increasing physical activity; maintaining a recommended \\nbody weight; and eating a healthy and nutritious diet. Taking advantage of cancer screening \\nalso will reduce your risk. For more information about preventing cancer, visit the following \\nwebsites The federal role in responding to unusual patterns of cancer is limited. As needed, \\nstate, tribal, local, or territorial health departments may request technical assistance in \\nresponse to unusual patterns of cancer from CDC/ATSDR. CDC/ATSDR may provide \\ntechnical recommendations and make referrals to the appropriate state, tribal, local, or \\nterritorial health department or cancer registry. ATSDR is directed bycongressional \\nmandateto perform specific functions concerning the effect on public health of hazardous \\nsubstances in the environment.

Dog flu likely poses a low threat \\nto people. Canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses are different from seasonal influenza A(H3N2) \\nviruses that commonly spread among people. To date, there is no evidence of spread of \\ncanine influenza viruses from dogs to people. There has not been a single reported case of \\nhuman infection with a canine influenza virus anywhere in the world. In 2016, CDC used \\ntheInfluenza Risk Assessment Toolto evaluate the potential risk of canine influenza \\nA(H3N2) viruses causing a pandemic and found it to be low. Influenza viruses are \\nconstantly changing. It is possible that a canine influenza A virus could change to gain the \\nability to infect and spread easily between people. Humans have little immunity against \\nnew, non-human (novel) influenza A viruses. Infections in people with novel influenza A \\nviruses are concerning when they occur. If these viruses acquire the ability to spread easily \\namong people, it could result in a pandemic. For this reason, the World Health Organization \\nconducts global flu surveillance, which has led to detection of novel influenza A virus \\ninfections in humans. Surveillance focuses on novel influenza A viruses of animal origin \\n(such as avian or swine influenza A viruses). The signs of this illness in dogs include: \\nHowever, not all dogs will show signs of illness. The severity of illness associated with \\ncanine flu in dogs can range from no signs to severe illness resulting in pneumonia and \\nsometimes death. Most dogs recover from dog flu within 2 to 3 weeks. However, some dogs \\nmay develop secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to more severe illness and \\npneumonia. Anyone who has concerns about their pet's health, or whose pet is showing \\nsigns of dog flu, should contact their veterinarian. Testing is available to confirm canine \\ninfluenza A(H3N2) virus infection in dogs. Your veterinarian can tell you if testing is \\nappropriate. H3N2 canine influenza viruses are not endemic in dogs in the United States but \\nmultiple, localized outbreaks with regional die-outs continue to occur, seeded by repeated \\nre-introductions from Asia. H3N8 canine influenza viruseshave not been reported since \\n2016and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore. If evidence emerges that canine \\ninfluenza viruses can infect people with the potential for sustained human-to-human \\nspread, CDC has a plan in place. CDC will execute itsexisting authoritiesto limit the \\nintroduction and/or spread of that pandemic virus into or within the United States. \\nCDCregulations requirethat dogs be healthy to enter the United States. Dogs may be denied \\nentry or further evaluated if they look like they could be sick with a communicable disease. \\nFor dogs that appear sick or are dead upon arrival in the United States, CDC can require a \\nveterinary examination or a necropsy (animal autopsy) at the owner's expense. Multiple \\nagencies may have regulatory authority over pets such as dogs and cats when entering the \\nUnited States.

Almost all dogs are susceptible to dog \\nflu infection. Dog flu tends to spread among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. Dog flu is \\nthought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets produced when infected dogs cough \\nor sneeze. It can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. Vaccines to \\nprotect dogs against H3N2 dog flu are available in the United States.

After exposure to \\ndogs showing signs of respiratory disease, people should clean and disinfect clothing, \\nequipment, surfaces, and hands. Canine influenza H3N8 viruses originated in horses and \\nspread to dogs. H3N8 equine (horse) influenza (flu) viruses have been known to exist in \\nhorses for more than 40 years. In 2004, cases of an unknown respiratory illness in dogs \\nwere reported in the United States. An investigation showed that this respiratory illness \\nwas caused by equine influenza viruses. Scientists believe that after jumping from horses to \\ndogs, the virus adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread among them. It spreads \\nespecially quickly among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. This is now considered a \\ndog-specific (canine) H3N8 virus. In September 2005, this virus was identified by experts as \\na \"newly emerging pathogen in the dog population\" in the United States. H3N8 canine \\ninfluenza viruseshave not been reported since 2016and do not appear to be actively \\ncirculating anymore. Canine influenza H3N2 virusesoriginated in birds and spread to dogs. \\nThe first H3N2 canine influenza viruses were reported in 2004. There has also been \\nreported spread of H3N2 canine influenza viruses from dogs to cats. H3N2 canine influenza \\nviruses were first detected in dogs in South Korea in 2007. These viruses have also been \\nreported in dogs in China, Thailand, and Canada. H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first \\ndetected in the United States inApril 2015. They have now been found in multiple U.S. states \\nand regions. To date, the H3N2 canine viruses reported in the United States have been \\nalmost identical genetically to those previously reported in Asia. Treatment for dog flu \\nlargely consists of supportive care. In milder cases, supportive care may include medication \\nto make your dog more comfortable and fluids to ensure that your dog remains well \\nhydrated. This helps to keep the dog comfortable and hydrated while its body mounts an \\nimmune response. Broad spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed by your veterinarian if \\nthey suspect a secondary bacterial infection. Influenza A viruses are found in many different \\nanimals, including ducks, chickens, pigs, whales, horses, seals and cats. Influenza B viruses \\nare only found in humans.

It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill. \\nMany household items including gas- and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and \\ncharcoal grills produce this poison gas. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are \\nheadache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO \\nsymptoms are often described as ?flu-like.? If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you \\npass out or kill you. People who are sleeping or drunk can die from CO poisoning before \\nthey have symptoms. Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning. Infants, the elderly, and people \\nwith chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from \\nCO. Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to \\nfires, more than 100,000 visit the emergency room, and more than 14,000 are hospitalized. \\nCO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, \\nstoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. CO can build up indoors and \\npoison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO \\npoisoning with a few small steps. Install battery-operated or battery back-up CO detectors \\nnear every sleeping area in your home. Check CO detector batteries when you change the \\ntime on your clocks each spring and fall to be sure they are functioning properly. Consider \\nbuying a detector with a digital readout. This type of detector can tell you the highest level \\nof CO concentration in your home, in addition to sounding an alarm.

These diseases have many causes, symptoms, and \\ntreatments and can affect people of all ages and races. When cardiomyopathy occurs, the \\nnormal muscle in the heart can thicken, stiffen, thin out, or fill with substances the body \\nproduces that do not belong in the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle's ability to \\npump blood is reduced. This, in turn, can lead to irregular heartbeats, the backup of blood \\ninto the lungs or rest of the body, and heart failure. Cardiomyopathy can be \\nacquired?developed because of another disease, condition, or factor?or inherited. The cause \\nisn't always known. The main types of cardiomyopathy include the following:1234 \\nDilated:meaning that one of the pumping chambers (ventricles) of the heart is enlarged. \\nThis is more common in males and is the most common form of cardiomyopathy in children. \\nIt can occur at any age and may or may not be inherited. Hypertrophic:where the heart \\nmuscle is thickened. This often presents in childhood or early adulthood and can cause \\nsudden death in adolescents and young adult athletes.1It is often an inherited condition, \\nand a person may not have any symptoms. If there is a family history of this, other family \\nmembers can be tested and adjust their activities to reduce the risk of sudden death. \\nArrhythmogenic:where the disease causes irregular heartbeats or rhythms. This is often \\ninherited and more common in males. Restrictive:where heart muscle is stiff or scarred, or \\nboth. It can occur with amyloidosis (a rare disease that occurs when a protein called \\namyloid builds up in organs), or hemochromatosis (a disorder in which extra iron builds up \\nin the body to harmful levels), and other conditions. This is the least common type. \\nCardiomyopathy often goes undiagnosed,5so the numbers can vary. As many as 1 of 500 \\nadults may have this condition.67Males and females of all ages and races can have \\ncardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is more common in Black people than in White \\npeople, and in males than in females.5 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to be the \\nmost common inherited or genetic heart disease. While this type of cardiomyopathy occurs \\nat many ages, in children and young adults with this condition there may be no symptoms. \\nYet they are at high risk of sudden cardiac death. Cardiomyopathy can occur in children \\nregardless of age, race, and gender. Pediatric cardiomyopathy can be inherited or acquired \\nthrough a viral infection, and sometimes the cause is unknown. It is a frequent cause of \\nsudden cardiac arrest in the young, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 108, 'page_label': '191'}, page_content=\"Institute. Treatment may include medications, changes to physical activity, or surgery. In \\nmany cases, early detection and intervention can help to improve outcomes for children. \\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare form of heart failure that can occur near the \\nend of pregnancy or up to a year after giving birth. The heart muscle becomes weak, causing \\na buildup of fluid in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swollen \\nankles or legs. Because these symptoms can also occur in a normal pregnancy, recognition \\nand treatment for this condition can be delayed. Women who are pregnant or who have \\nrecently delivered a baby should seek medical care immediately if they are experiencing \\nanyurgent maternal warning signs. These symptoms could indicate a life-threatening \\nsituation. Treatment may include close monitoring by the woman's health care team and \\nprescription medication. Many medicines may be safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, \\nincluding diuretics, beta-blockers, or blood thinners.8 The risk of PPCM is higher for Black \\nwomen and for women who are older than 30, who are pregnant with more than one fetus, \\nor who have a history of preeclampsia or chronic high blood pressure.9 Some people who \\nhave cardiomyopathy never have symptoms, while others may show signs as the disease \\nprogresses. These might include the following: Although the cause of cardiomyopathy is \\nsometimes unknown, certain diseases or conditions can lead to cardiomyopathy. These \\ninclude the following:1234 The goal of treatment is to slow down the disease, control \\nsymptoms, and prevent sudden death. If you are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, your \\ndoctor may tell you to change your diet and physical activity, reduce stress, avoid alcohol \\nand other drugs, and take medicines. Your doctor may also treat you for the conditions that \\nled to cardiomyopathy, if they exist, or recommend surgery. Treatment also depends on \\nwhich type of cardiomyopathy you have. Genetic or inherited types of cardiomyopathy \\ncannot be prevented. Adopting or following a healthier lifestyle can help control symptoms \\nand complications. If you have an underlying disease or condition that can cause \\ncardiomyopathy, early treatment of that condition can help prevent the disease from \\ndeveloping.

By then, treatments might be less \\nlikely to work. Cascade testing offers one way of finding people with genetic conditions \\nbefore they show symptoms, allowing them to take steps to prevent disease or treat it early. \\nIf you have been diagnosed with a genetic condition, your family members are more likely \\nto have it, too. Sharing your diagnosis with your family members allows them to learn more \\nand be checked for the condition. Finding and treating a genetic condition early can lead to \\nbetter health. Family members who are most likely to have the same genetic change, or \\nmutation, are tested first. From there, genetic testing \"cascades\" through the family \\ndepending on who has the genetic change and who does not. For example, if genetic testing \\nshows that your mother has the same genetic change that you have, family members on \\nyour mother\\'s side would be tested. Your father\\'s side would not need to be tested. The first \\nstep in cascade testing is to let your family members know about your diagnosis and genetic \\ntest results. Here are some tips to get started: Talking about having an increased risk of \\ndeveloping cancer, heart disease, or other hereditary conditions may be difficult for some \\nfamily members. Before talking to family members about their risk of having the same \\ngenetic change, it could be helpful to anticipate possible reactions. For example, if you think \\nthat a family member might get emotional from learning this information, it might be best to \\ntell them about this in a comfortable, private area. If a family member refuses to talk about \\nthis information, it is important to respect their decision. Some people do not want to know \\nabout their risks for developing certain diseases because it will cause them too much '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 110, 'page_label': '193'}, page_content=\"anxiety.

CASPER is quick, relatively inexpensive, \\nflexible, and uses a simple reporting format. It uses a valid sampling methodology to collect \\ninformation at the household level. CASPER is a type of rapid needs assessment (RNA) that \\nprovides household-level information to public health leaders and emergency managers. \\nCASPER can provide accurate and timely data for decision makers through precise analysis \\nand interpretation. CASPER is a cross-sectional epidemiologic design; it is not surveillance. \\nInformation from CASPERs can help public health and emergency managers: The CASPER \\nmethodology is an adaptation of epidemiologic techniques used by scientists in the World \\nHealth Organization's (WHO's) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) who estimate \\nvaccine coverage in Africa. CASPER'scluster sampling designinvolves two stages. The first \\nstage includes 30 clusters selected probability proportional to size. The second stage \\nincludes seven households interviewed within each cluster. This design provides estimates \\nfor the population. There may be situations in which this design is not feasible or \\nideal.Modificationsare acceptable. For additional information, read theCASPER Overview \\nfact sheet. There are many opportunities for CASPERs to influence public health. A CASPER \\ncan be used in both a disaster and non-disaster setting. For example, CASPER methodology \\nhas been used to do the following: Information is key for decision-making.

CASPER addresses this by providing valid information rapidly about the general \\nand health needs of a community to decision-makers. CASPER is generalizable (providing \\npopulation estimates), timely, relatively low cost, reported in a simple format, and flexible. \\nCASPER was originally designed to provide information during a disaster response. It can \\nalso be used when population-representative data are needed during other disaster phases \\n(preparedness, recovery, mitigation). Additionally, it can be used in situations unrelated to a \\ndisaster. For example, public health departments have used CASPER to: The primary goals \\nof the CASPER are to rapidly obtain information about the needs of an affected community \\nand to assess changes in needs during the response or recovery period. CASPER also \\nproduces household-based population estimates of needs for decision makers. Examples of \\nCASPER objectives include the following: CASPER is not intended to deliver food, medicine, \\nmedical services or other resources to the affected area or to provide direct services to \\nresidents such as cleanup or home repair. In the early 2000s, the two-stage cluster method \\nbecame an increasingly widespread method for disaster response. CDC?s National Center \\nfor Environmental Health developed theCASPER Toolkitto outline and standardize the \\nassessment methodology.  CDC coined the term CASPER to distinguish it from other rapid \\nneeds assessments. The CASPER toolkit provides guidelines to assist personnel from any \\nfederal, state, tribal, local, or territorial (STLT) public health department or other \\nemergency response agencies in conducting CASPER. The toolkit is focused on United States \\ndisaster response. However, it may also be adapted for use in a non-disaster or \\ninternational setting. The toolkit provides a standardized, step-by-step guide for conducting \\na CASPER, including: Public health personnel, emergency management officials, academics, \\nor others who wish to assess household-level public health needs will find the toolkit useful \\nfor rapid data collection for actionable decision-making during disaster or non-emergency \\nsituations. Data from CASPERs are used for the following: Other potential benefits of \\nCASPER data include the following: CASPER data have been useful to support resource \\nallocation, fund projects or services, tailor messages, and inform future planning. During a \\ndisaster, the local, state, or regional emergency managers or health department officers may \\ndecide to initiate a CASPER when at least one of the following conditions occurs: CASPER \\nmethodology can be used in both a disaster and non-disaster setting. CASPERs have been \\nconducted to assess public health perceptions and to estimate needs of a community during \\na non-disaster setting. Regardless of the setting and objectives, once the decision to conduct \\nthe CASPER has been made, it should be initiated as soon as possible. CDC is available for \\ntechnical assistance for any CASPER, regardless of type (preparedness, response, recovery, \\nnon-disaster, etc.). Prior to conducting a CASPER, consider whether CASPER provides an \\nappropriate sampling methodology based on your: A clear understanding of how CASPER \\ninformation will be used, who the relevant partners are, and needed and available resources \\nis important prior to moving forward with your CASPER. Remember, a CASPER will be \\ndescriptive of the entire sampling frame (geographic area from which your sample is \\ndrawn). It will not provide detailed information on subpopulations or specific groups. For \\nexample, if you want to determine the needs or status of pregnant people or persons \\nexperiencing homelessness, you should not conduct a CASPER. There are four phases in a \\nCASPER: prepare for the CASPER; conduct the CASPER in the field; analyze the data; and '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 112, 'page_label': '195'}, page_content='write the report.

Keep in mind that \\npreparing for a CASPER can take several hours (e.g., during a response) or, if time allows, \\nseveral months (e.g., in a non-disaster setting). CASPER is conducted through face-to-face \\ninterviews in the field. There are several advantages to conducting face-to-face interviews. \\nThese include a high response rate and the ability to distribute health information or other \\nmaterials to the community. Face-to-face interviews have the additional benefit of directly \\nconnecting the community to local staff, increasing the visibility of and trust in the health \\ndepartment. Interview teams can also provide anecdotal information (e.g., direct visual \\ninspection of a disaster-affected area, common concerns overheard in the community not \\ncaptured in the questionnaire) that can help guide response and recovery efforts, \\nimplementation of any recommendations, and future plans. Data from the questionnaire can \\nbe entered into any statistical software package that allows for multistage sample design \\nweighting. CDC recommends using Epi Info?, which is user-friendly, does not require \\ncomputer permissions for download, and is available free of charge. Access tutorials and \\nguidance onEpi Info?. Data from the tracking form can be entered into any spreadsheet such \\nas Microsoft Excel. Disseminating findings is a vital component of a CASPER.

Below is a list of diseases that can be spread by cats. Wash your handswith soap and \\nrunning water: Adults should supervise hand washing for children under 5 years old. \\nUse hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. \\nWear gloves while gardening, particularly if you know that outdoor cats live in the area. \\nCats can carry many germs in their poop. To stay healthy, take precautions when cleaning a \\ncat's litter box. Change litter boxes daily. \\nAlways wash your hands after cleaning the litter box, even if you use a scoop to remove the \\npoop. People with weakened immune systems and pregnant womenshould not clean litter \\nboxes, if possible. They are more at risk for complications from germs spread by cats. If no \\none else can perform the task, wear disposable gloves and wash your hands afterwards. \\nKeep your cat's litter box away from other animals, children, and food preparation areas. \\nCat bites and scratches can spread germs, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious. \\nFor example, cat scratch disease can happen if a scratch only breaks the surface of the skin. \\nWe don?t know exactly how many people are bitten or scratched by cats each year because \\nincidents often aren?t reported. However, we do know that about 20-80% of reported cat \\nbites and scratches become infected. Be cautious with unfamiliar animals. Avoid rough play \\nwith cats and kittens.

These parasites are released from infected snails into fresh and salt water (such \\nas lakes, ponds, and oceans). While the parasite?s preferred host is the specific bird or \\nmammal, if the parasite comes into contact with a swimmer, it burrows into the skin \\ncausing an allergic reaction and rash. Swimmer?s itch is found throughout the world and is \\nmore frequent during summer months. Symptoms can include Within minutes to days after \\nswimming in contaminated water, you may experience tingling, burning, or itching of the \\nskin. Small reddish pimples appear within twelve hours. Pimples may develop into small \\nblisters. Scratching the areas may result in secondary bacterial infections. Itching may last \\nup to a week or more but will gradually go away. Because swimmer?s itch is caused by an \\nallergic reaction to infection, the more often you swim or wade in contaminated water, the \\nmore likely you are to develop more serious symptoms. The greater the number of \\nexposures to contaminated water, the more intense and immediate symptoms of \\nswimmer?s itch will be. Be aware that swimmer's itch is not the only rash that may occur \\nafter swimming in fresh or salt water. Anyone who swims or wades in infested water may \\nbe at risk. Larvae are more likely to be present in shallow water by the shoreline. Children \\nare most often affected because they tend to swim, wade, and play in the shallow water \\nmore than adults. Also, they are less likely to towel dry themselves when leaving the water. \\nMany factors must be present for swimmer?s itch to become a problem in water. Since these \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 123, 'page_label': '206'}, page_content='factors change (sometimes within a swim season), swimmer?s itch will not always be a \\nproblem. However, there is no way to know how long water may be unsafe. Larvae \\ngenerally survive for 24 hours once they are released from the snail. However, an infected \\nsnail will continue to produce cercariae throughout the remainder of its life. For future \\nsnails to become infected, migratory birds or mammals in the area must also be infected so \\nthe lifecycle can continue. As long as your swimming pool is well maintained and \\nchlorinated, there is no risk of swimmer?s itch. The appropriate snails must be present in \\norder for swimmer?s itch to occur. The adult parasite lives in the blood of infected animals \\nsuch as ducks, geese, gulls, swans, and certain mammals such as muskrats and raccoons. \\nThe parasites produce eggs that are passed in the feces of infected birds or mammals. If the \\neggs land in or are washed into the water, the eggs hatch, releasing small, free-swimming \\nmicroscopic larvae. These larvae swim in the water in search of a certain species of aquatic \\nsnail. If the larvae find one of these snails, they infect the snail, multiply and undergo further \\ndevelopment. Infected snails release a different type of microscopic larvae (or cercariae, \\nhence the name cercarial dermatitis) into the water. This larval form then swims about \\nsearching for a suitable host (bird, muskrat) to continue the lifecycle. Although humans are \\nnot suitable hosts, the microscopic larvae burrow into the swimmer?s skin, and may cause \\nan allergic reaction and rash. Because these larvae cannot develop inside a human, they \\nsoon die. To reduce the likelihood of developing swimmer?s itch Most cases of swimmer?s \\nitch do not require medical attention. If you have a rash, you may try the following for relief: \\nThough difficult, try not to scratch. Scratching may cause the rash to become infected. If \\nitching is severe, your health care provider may suggest prescription-strength lotions or \\ncreams to lessen your symptoms.

For \\nan online option, thePoisonHelp.orginteractive toolprompts users to answer a few simple \\nquestions about their exposure to one of the approximately 325,000 unique products and \\nsubstances in the system. Carbon monoxide (CO)is an odorless, colorless gas that can lead to \\nsudden illness or death if inhaled at high concentrations. After a disaster, there may be \\npower outages. This can result in people using alternative sources of fuel or electricity for \\nheating, cooling, or cooking. These sources can lead to elevated CO levels in enclosed spaces, \\npoisoning people and animals inside. CDC usesNPDSfor surveillance during disaster \\nresponse and recovery efforts to track reported exposures to CO. Using these data can help \\ninform public health messaging to prevent further injury and death. In April 2020, CDC \\npublished areportthat described an increase in calls to poison centers about exposures to \\ncleaners and disinfectants. Using data from NPDS, CDC and America's Poison Centers found \\nthat poison centers nationwide received 45,550 calls regarding exposures to cleaners and \\ndisinfectants during the first three months of 2020-an increase of about 20% from the same \\ntimeframe in 2019. The timing of these reported exposures corresponded to increased \\nmedia coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of consumer shortages of cleaning and \\ndisinfection products, and the beginning of some local and state stay-at-home orders. The \\nresults of this study highlighted the importance of safe and appropriate use of cleaners and \\ndisinfectants to prevent potential poisonings and injuries. Harmful algal blooms(HABs) are \\nthe rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria that can cause harm to people, animals, and the \\nenvironment. In 2019, CDC and America?s Poison Centers worked with five poison centers \\nto conduct follow-up surveys with people who had called regarding a HAB exposure. Fifty-\\nfive people were interviewed. Most callers (65%) stated they were exposed through \\nmultiple routes with the most common being skin contact (84%) and ingestion (60%). The \\nmost frequently reported source of exposure was bathing or swimming in contaminated \\nwater. Few callers had heard or read warnings about the dangers of HABs before or during \\ntheir exposure. This study highlights the importance of characterizing exposures to HABs to \\ntailor public health messaging. CDC launched an investigation in April 2015 after being \\nalerted to an increase in poison center calls related to synthetic cannabinoids, also known \\nas synthetic marijuana. The results,published in MMWR, led to a surge in media coverage on \\nthis issue that created a broader awareness of issues and dangers of using synthetic \\ncannabinoids. Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are devices that heat a liquid mixture to \\nallow users to inhale an aerosol that typically contains nicotine, flavorings, and other \\nadditives. While long-term impacts of these products on public health are unknown, one \\narea of concern is the potential for poisonings. A CDCstudyfound that 2,405 e-cigarette \\nexposures were reported to poison centers from September 2010 to February 2014. This \\nwork informed public health actions including the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act \\nof 2015, enacted in January 2016. This law requires any container of liquid nicotine that is \\nsold, manufactured, distributed, or imported into the United States use packaging that is \\ndifficult for children under 5 years of age to open. From May 17?June 17, 2012, poison \\ncenters across the countryreported485 cases of children being exposed to detergent-filled \\nlaundry pods. CDC partnered with America's Poison Centers and poison centers in Charlotte \\nand Philadelphia to investigate this public health threat. Their work helped contribute to \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 128, 'page_label': '211'}, page_content=\"the decision by the largest manufacturer of laundry detergent pods in the United States to \\nadd a double latch lid safety feature to their containers. Manufacturers have also worked \\nwith poison centers to study risk factors and health outcomes linked to laundry detergent \\npod exposures. CDC tracked all calls to poison centers related to the 2011 Japan nuclear \\nevent. Between March 11 and April 18, NPDS tracked 340 information requests and 64 calls \\nregarding potential radiation, potassium iodide and iodide product exposures. Call details \\nwere analyzed daily for situational awareness and to inform public health response efforts. \\nStaff from CDC and America?s Poison Centers performed detailed follow up and data review \\nto confirm exposure status. Surveillance for calls related to potassium iodide (a medication \\nused to prevent the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid) exposures documented \\nadverse outcomes in persons taking this product in response to a perceived risk from this \\nevent. During 2010, 1838 calls were received by 57 poison centers related to the Deepwater \\nHorizon explosion and oil spill. Of these, 1,160 were self-reported exposures and symptoms, \\nincluding cough, nausea, headache, eye irritation, throat irritation, chest pain, dizziness, \\ndifficulty breathing, and rash. The data were used to identify trends and monitor severity of \\nhealth effects. This information helped public health officials determine the impact of the oil \\nspill on health.

There are four common types of abuse and neglect: For more information \\nabout child abuse and neglect definitions please seeChild Maltreatment Surveillance: \\nUniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements [4.12 MB, 148 \\nPages, 508]. Child abuse and neglect are common. At least one in seven children \\nexperienced child abuse or neglect in the past year in the United States.3This is likely an \\nunderestimate because many cases are unreported. In 2021, 1,820 children died of abuse \\nand neglect in the United States.4 Children living in poverty experience more abuse and \\nneglect. Experiencing poverty can place a lot of stress on families, which may increase the \\nrisk for child abuse and neglect. Rates of child abuse and neglect are five times higher for \\nchildren in families with low socioeconomic status compared to families with a higher \\nsocioeconomic status.1 Child maltreatment is costly. In the United States, the total lifetime \\neconomic burden associated with child abuse and neglect was about $592 billion in \\n2018.5This economic burden rivals the cost of other high-profile public health problems, \\nsuch as heart disease and diabetes.6 Children who are abused or neglected may suffer \\nimmediate physical injuries such as cuts, bruises, or broken bones. They may also have \\nemotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety or posttraumatic stress.1 Over the \\nlong term, children who are abused or neglected are also at increased risk for experiencing \\nfuture violence victimization and perpetration, substance abuse, sexually transmitted \\ninfections, delayed brain development, lower educational attainment, and limited \\nemployment opportunities.1 Abuse and neglect may result in toxic stress, which can change \\nbrain development and increase the risk for problems like posttraumatic stress disorder \\nand learning, attention, and memory difficulties.7 Child abuse and neglect can be \\nprevented.Certain factors may increase or decrease the riskof perpetrating or experiencing \\nchild abuse and neglect.

People are exposed to lead by eating lead paint chips, ingesting contaminated food \\nor water, and/or by breathing in lead dust. Children younger than 6 years are more likely to \\nbe exposed due to their hand-to-mouth behavior. Many children ingest lead dust by putting \\nobjects such as toys and dirt in their mouths. No safe blood lead level (BLL) in children has \\nbeen identified. Even low levels of lead in blood are associated with developmental delays, \\ndifficulty learning, and behavioral issues. Theeffectsof lead poisoning can be permanent and \\ndisabling. There are steps that parents and healthcare providers can take toprotect children \\nfrom lead exposure. Healthcare providers can perform a blood lead test if a child was or \\nmay have been exposed to lead. CDC uses ablood lead reference value(BLRV) of 3.5 \\nmicrograms per deciliter (µg/dL). This reference level helps identify children with BLLs \\nhigher than most children's levels. CDC estimates that approximately 500,000 children in \\nthe United States have BLLs at or above the BLRV. Healthcare providers can use \\nCDC'sRecommended Actions Based on Blood Lead Levelto develop a plan of action for their \\npatient.

Some children are at a greater risk for lead exposure from paint, water, \\nsoil, some imported items and industrial sources. They may also be exposed through their \\nparents and caregivers from certain jobs and hobbies. Children can be exposed to lead \\nwhere they live, learn, and play. Sources of lead exposure can include the following: The \\ngoal of CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) is toprevent \\nchildhood lead exposurebefore any harm occurs. Through CLPPP, CDC supportsstate and \\nlocal public health departmentswith funds for surveillance and prevention of lead exposure. \\nA blood lead test is the best way to determine if a child has been exposed to lead.

When chlorine gas touches moist tissues (like the eyes, throat, and lungs) it \\ncreates an acid that can hurt these tissues. If high amounts are breathed in, breathing \\nproblems may show up right away. Symptoms of exposure to higher levels of chlorine \\ninclude the following: If low amounts are breathed in, symptoms may show up later. If \\nchlorine is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the \\nchlorine gas. \\nIf chlorine is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains \\nchlorine.

You can get cholera from drinking water or eating food containing cholera \\nbacteria. Most people who get cholera don't get sick. However, choleracan cause life-\\nthreatening watery diarrheaand vomiting. Every year, an estimated 1.3 to 4 million people \\naround the world get cholera, and between 21,000 to 143,000 people die. With early and \\nproper treatment, even severely ill patients can survive cholera. Most people who get \\ncholera have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. About 1 in 10 people develop severe \\nsymptoms such as watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. Losing body fluids quickly \\ncan lead to dehydration and shock. People living in areas with unsafe drinking water, poor \\nsanitation, and inadequate hygiene are at highest risk of getting cholera. U.S. residents can \\nget cholera while traveling abroad and sometimes become ill after returning home. Some \\ntravelers have gotten sick after bringing contaminated seafood home with them from \\nabroad. People usually get cholera from drinking water or eating food that contains traces \\nof poop from someone with cholera. The disease can spread quickly in areas where sewage \\nand drinking water aren't adequately treated. Cholera bacteria also can live in brackish \\n(slightly salty) and coastal waters. Eating raw shellfish can cause cholera. Cholera is not \\nlikely to spread from person to person or from casual contact with someone with cholera. If \\nyou plan to travel, check if cholera is common or ongoing in the area you are visiting. If \\ncholera is present, washing your hands with soap and safe water, drinking treated water, \\nand getting vaccinated against cholera are among the steps that can help prevent you from \\ngetting sick. If you think you or a family member might have cholera, get medical attention \\nimmediately. Dehydration can occur quickly and replacing lost fluids is essential. For babies \\nwith watery diarrhea, continue feeding them breast milk or formula to help them stay \\nhydrated.

It causes \\nsevere fatigue not improved by rest, problems thinking and sleeping, dizziness, pain,  and \\nmany other symptoms. People with ME/CFS may not look sick but can't do their normal \\nactivities. ME/CFS may get worse after they do any activity -- physical or mental. This \\nsymptom is called post-exertional malaise (PEM). After they exert themselves, they may \\nneed to stay in bed for an extended time. About 1 in 4 people with ME/CFS are confined to \\nbed at some point in their illness. It is difficult to diagnose because there is no specific test \\nfor ME/CFS. One reason that people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed may be limited \\naccess to healthcare. Another reason may be a lack of healthcare providers who know about \\nME/CFS and how to recognize it. Anyone can get ME/CFS. It doesn't matter what age, \\ngender or ethnicity they are. However, some groups are more affected than others. People \\nwith ME/CFS are not able to function the same way they did before they became ill. They \\nmay not always be able to do daily tasks like showering or cooking a meal. ME/CFS often \\nmakes it hard to keep a job, go to school, and take part in family and social life.

ME/CFS is most common in people \\nin middle age but also affects kids, teens and elderly people. Among adults, women are \\naffected more often than men. Among children, teens are more affected than younger kids. \\nPeople who are white are diagnosed more often than other races and ethnicities. But many \\npeople with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, especially among people from racial and \\nethnic minority groups. Symptoms of ME/CFS may appear similar to many other illnesses. \\nThere is no test to confirm ME/CFS. This makes it difficult to diagnose. The illness can also \\nbe unpredictable. Symptoms may come and go, or there may be changes in how severe \\nsymptoms are over time. A doctor should be able to distinguish ME/CFS from other \\nillnesses by doing a thorough medical exam. This includes asking many questions about the \\npatient's health history and current illness. They should also ask about how often symptoms \\noccur, how bad they are, and how long they have lasted. It is also important for doctors to \\ntalk with patients about how the symptoms affect their lives. There is no cure or approved \\ntreatment for ME/CFS. But some symptoms can be treated or managed. Treating these \\nsymptoms might provide relief for some people with ME/CFS but not others. Other \\nstrategies, like learning new ways to manage activity, can also help. People with ME/CFS, \\ntheir families, and healthcare providers need to work together to decide which symptom \\ncauses the most problems. This should be treated first after discussing possible benefits and \\nharms of any treatment plans, including medicines and other therapies. Healthcare \\nproviders need to support their patients' families as they come to understand how to live \\nwith this illness. Providers and families should remember that this process is likely to be \\nhard on people with ME/CFS. ME/CFS is a serious, debilitating illness that makes it hard for \\npeople to do activities they could previously do without difficulty.

Some of these \\nsymptoms are well-recognized and specific to the type of infection, for example, loss of \\nsmell and COVID-19. Other symptoms are unexplained and general (e.g., fatigue or difficulty \\nthinking). Similar symptoms can follow many different types of infections. (In alphabetical \\norder) Some people with chronic symptoms following infections may not know which \\ninfection triggered the symptoms, or even recognize that they had an infection before their \\nchronic symptoms began. People with chronic symptoms and unknown preceding infection \\nmay be diagnosed withmyalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. General \\nsymptoms can include: It is not fully known why some people experience chronic general \\nsymptoms. The type, duration, and intensity of chronic symptoms following an infection can \\nbe different from person to person. Symptoms may come and go or vary in severity (how \\nbad the person feels over time). Some patients? symptoms slowly improve with time. \\nHowever, it can take weeks and sometimes years to feel well. The longer fatigue or other \\nsymptoms last, the more likely they are to lead to other problems, such as physical \\nweakness or difficulty with performing daily activities. Long-term illnesses can also impact \\nrelationships and a person?s mental health. It is important to talk to a healthcare provider if \\nyou are concerned about any symptoms that last a long time.

It has been reported in the United States, Canada, Norway, \\nFinland, Sweden and South Korea. No CWD infections in people have ever been reported. \\nAnd it's not known if people can even get infected with CWD. However, CWD is related to \\nanother prion disease in animals thatdoesinfect people. So, it is considered a theoretical risk \\nto people. Some studies in monkeys suggest they can get CWD by eating meat or brain \\ntissues of infected deer or elk. These studies raise concerns CWD may also pose a risk to \\npeople. In the United States, CWD was first identified in the 1960s in captive deer. In 1981, \\nthe first wild deer with CWD was reported. Since then, the disease has been reported in wild \\ndeer in more than half of U.S. states. It's possible that CWD is also in other states but hasn't \\nbeen reported yet. Once the disease is established in an area, the CWD prions can stay in the \\nenvironment (soil) for years. If CWD could spread to people, it would most likely be by \\neating meat from an infected animal. ACDC surveyof U.S. residents showed nearly 1 in 5 said \\nthey had hunted deer or elk. More than 6 in 10 said they had eaten venison or elk meat. \\nThese groups would likely be most at risk if CWD spreads to people. Chronic wasting \\ndisease is a type of prion disease. Prions are proteins that are normally found in the body. In \\nrare cases, the proteins misfold, causing serious symptoms in the animal or person affected. \\nOnce a person or animal gets sick, the disease moves to the brain and spine and eventually \\nleads to death. Scientists believe CWD proteins (prions) spread between animals through \\nbody fluids like feces, saliva, blood, or urine. This can occur either through direct contact or \\nindirectly through contamination of soil, food or water. When hunting in areas with CWD \\nactivity, follow these steps to reduce your risk of contact with the disease: When field-\\ndressing a deer or handling meat: Check state wildlife and health department \\nrecommendations before you hunt. See if they recommend or require testing animals for \\nCWD is the hunting area. Recommendations vary by state. Strongly consider having the deer \\nor elk tested for CWD before you eat the meat. If your deer is processed commercially, \\nconsider asking to have your animal be processed individually. This ensures you are only \\ngetting meat from your animal. If your animal tests positive for CWD, do not eat meat from \\nthat animal. CDC has been working with health officials in states where CWD has been \\nreported for decades. We are collaborating to watch for potential CWD cases in people. By \\nsurveying hunters' health in states with long CWD histories, we hope to have early warnings \\nif it spreads to people.

In \\nrecent years in the United States, about 500-600 cases have been reported per year. There \\nare three main types of CJD infection: The vast majority of all CJD cases reported (about 85 \\npercent) are called sporadic. These types of cases occur when prion proteins already in the \\nbody misfold for some unknown reason. The result is disease that breaks down the brain\\'s \\nfunctions. Some cases are fatal within a few months of the first symptoms, and most are \\nfatal within a year. About 5-15 percent of CJD cases occur because the person has inherited \\na mutation in the prion protein gene. A person with CJD with a first-degree relative (parent, \\nsibling, or child) who also has the disease would have familial CJD. Iatrogenic cases are \\ncaused by contact with prions in a healthcare setting or due to biological products. There \\nhave been six known CJD cases caused by surgical or medical equipment contaminated with \\nprions is used on another patient. People who received prion-contaminated human growth \\nhormone prior to 1978 may also develop iatrogenic CJD. Even 50 years later, cases are still \\nbeing identified. Finally, cases can occur in people who receive a transplant of specific \\nmaterials. These include corneal (eye) grafts or dura mater (a membrane in the brain and \\nspinal cord) grafts. If the donor had CJD that was not discovered before the donation, \\nrecipients can contract CJD. People with CJD suffer from dementia. Other symptoms may \\ninclude trouble walking, sudden jerky movements, and visual disturbances. CJD patients \\nusually die within one year following the onset of symptoms. Healthcare providers can \\ndiagnose an illness as a suspect case based on: The only way to confirm CJD is through \\ntesting brain tissue from a biopsy or an autopsy. Classic CJD is always fatal, usually within a \\nfew months. There is unfortunately no therapy that will slow or stop the progression of \\ndisease. So, treatment involves supportive care to make the patient more comfortable. \\nThough they have very similar names, CJD and variant CJD (vCJD) are not the same disease. \\nBoth are prion diseases. However, variant CJD is tied to eating meat from cows infected with \\nbovine spongiform encephalopathy (sometimes called Mad Cow Disease). CJD, sometimes \\ncalled \"classic CJD\" to avoid confusion, mostly occurs sporadically. Unlike variant CJD, \\nclassic CJD is not caused by any other prion disease. In general, classic CJD affects people \\nolder than 55 while vCJD cases were younger, with an average age of 28. Classic CJD \\nprogresses much more quickly, causing death in an average of 4-5 months, while vCJD \\naverages more than a year.

Botulism causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, \\nand even death. The toxin is made byClostridium botulinumand sometimesClostridium \\nbutyricumandClostridium baratiibacteria (germs). These bacteria can produce the toxin in \\nfood, wounds, and the intestines of infants. The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are \\nfound naturally in many places, but it\\'s rare for them to make people sick. These bacteria \\nmake spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the \\nenvironment, even in extreme conditions. The spores usually do not cause people to become \\nsick, even when they\\'re eaten. But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and \\nmake one of the most lethal toxins known. The conditions in which the spores can grow and \\nmake toxin are: For example, improperlyhome-canned, preserved, or fermented foodscan \\nprovide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. When people eat \\nthese foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don\\'t get proper medical \\ntreatment quickly. There are 5 main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism can happen by \\neating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of \\nfoodborne botulism arehomemade foodsthat have been improperly canned, preserved, or \\nfermented.

It also can \\nhappen if too much of the toxin is injected for medical reasons, such as for migraine \\nheadaches. Adult intestinal toxemia is also known as adult intestinal colonization. This kind \\nof botulism is a very rare. It can happen if the spores of the bacteria get into an adult's \\nintestines, grow, and produce the toxin (similar to infant botulism).

Some babies should be tested for hemophilia soon after birth, including \\nUmbilical cord blood testing is better at finding low levels of factor VIII (8) (the factor that is \\nlow in hemophilia A) than it is at finding low levels of factor IX (9) (the factor that is low in \\nhemophilia B). This is because factor IX levels take more time to develop and are not at a \\nnormal level until a baby is at least 6 months of age. Therefore, a mildly low level of factor IX \\nat birth does not necessarily mean that the baby has hemophilia B. A repeat test when the \\nbaby is older might be needed in some cases. Learn more about theinheritance pattern for \\nhemophilia. About 1 in 3 babies who are diagnosed with hemophilia have no other family \\nmembers with the disorder. A doctor might check for hemophilia in a newborn if If a child \\nwith hemophilia  is not diagnosed during the newborn period, the family might notice \\nunusual bruising once the child begins standing or crawling. Those with severe hemophilia \\ncan have serious bleeding problems right away and are often diagnosed during the first year \\nof life. People with milder forms of hemophilia might not be diagnosed until later in life. \\nMany people who have or have had family members with hemophilia will ask that their \\nbaby be tested soon after birth.

Factors VIII and IX are proteins in the blood that help form clots and stop bleeding. \\nScreening tests are blood tests that show if the blood is clotting properly. Types of screening \\ntests include the following: This test measures the amount of hemoglobin (the red pigment \\ninside red blood cells that carries oxygen), the size and number of red blood cells, and \\nnumbers of different types of white blood cells and platelets found in blood. The CBC might \\nbe normal in people with hemophilia. However, if a person with hemophilia has unusually \\nheavy bleeding or bleeds for a long time, the hemoglobin and the red blood cell count can be \\nlow. This test measures how long it takes for blood to clot. It measures the clotting ability of \\nfactors VIII (8), IX (9), XI (11), and XII (12). If any of these clotting factors is too low, it takes \\nlonger than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will show a longer clotting \\ntime among people with hemophilia A or B. This test also measures the time it takes for \\nblood to clot. It measures primarily the clotting ability of factors I (1), II (2), V (5), VII (7), \\nand X (10). If any of these factors are too low, it takes longer than normal for the blood to \\nclot. The results of this test will be normal among most people with hemophilia A and B. \\nThis test also helps doctors assess a patient\\'s ability to form a blood clot. This test is \\nordered either along with other blood clotting tests or when a patient has an abnormal PT \\nor APTT test result, or both. Fibrinogen is another name for clotting factor I. Clotting factor \\ntests, also called factor assays, determine the clotting activity of factors VIII and IX in the \\nblood. Factors VIII and IX are proteins in the blood that help form clots and stop bleeding. \\nClotting factor tests are required to diagnose a bleeding disorder and will show the type of \\nhemophilia and the severity. It is important to know the type and severity in order to create \\nthe best treatment plan. Baseline clotting factor activityis used to determine hemophilia \\nseverity. It is measured prior to receiving any treatment and is used because it best \\nrepresents a person\\'s inherent clotting factor activity. Results are reported as a percentage \\nof a \"normal\" level of clotting factor. The average normal factor level is 100%, with the \\nnormal range generally defined as 50% to 150%. The hemophilia severity categories based \\non clotting factor levels in the table below were defined by the International Society on \\nThrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) in 2001.12 Severity Levels of factor VIII (8) or factor IX \\n(9) in the blood Mild hemophilia Greater than 5% but less than 40% Moderate hemophilia \\n1% to 5% Severe hemophilia Less than 1% Table notes.The 2001 ISTH classification did not \\naddress individuals with clotting factor levels ?40% but <50%. However, bleeding has been \\nobserved in some individuals with clotting factor levels ?40% and researchers are taking \\nsteps towards classifying these individuals. In 20213, ISTH recommended the following \\nterms for women and girls with an abnormal hemophilia gene who have a clotting factor \\nlevel ?40%: \"symptomatic carrier\" (a person who has clotting factor levels ?40% \\nandbleeding symptoms) and \"asymptomatic carrier\" (a person who has clotting factor \\nlevels ?40% who does not have bleeding symptoms). Women and girls with an abnormal \\nhemophilia gene who have a clotting factor level <40% are classified as having mild, \\nmoderate, or severe hemophilia depending on their exact clotting factor level. Hemophilia is \\nusually an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly. People \\nwith hemophilia can live full lives and enjoy most of the activities that other people do. \\nLanguages Language Assistance \\n '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 169, 'page_label': '252'}, page_content=\"-------------------------------------------------- \\nDisease: Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program \\nURL: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/cwhsp/about/index.html \\nDisease Information: The NIOSH Coal Workers?

Flu is caused by \\ninfluenza viruses only, whereas the common cold can be caused by a number of different \\nviruses, including rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, andseasonal coronaviruses. Seasonal \\ncoronaviruses should not be confused with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causesCOVID-19. \\nBecause flu and the common cold have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to tell the \\ndifference between them based on symptoms alone. In general, flu is worse than the \\ncommon cold, and symptoms are typically more intense and begin more abruptly. Colds are \\nusually milder than flu. People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose \\nthan people who have flu. Colds generally do not result in serious health problems, such as \\npneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalizations. Flu can have seriousassociated \\ncomplications. Because colds and flu share many symptoms, it can be difficult (or even \\nimpossible) to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Special tests can \\ntell if a person is sick with flu. The signs andsymptoms of flucan include fever or feeling \\nfeverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, \\nand fatigue (tiredness). Cold symptoms are usually milder than the symptoms of flu. People \\nwith colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose. Colds generally do not result in \\nserious health problems.

The most commonsymptomsare fever, chills, headache, body \\naches, and feeling tired. Most people who become ill have mild disease and recover \\ncompletely. However, weakness and fatigue may last several weeks. In rare cases, some \\npatients may develop more severe illness that affects the central nervous system.

Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by \\ndifferent respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed \\nschool and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three \\ncolds, and children often have more. The signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within \\n2 to 3 days of infection and can include: Complications from infection with respiratory \\nviruses can include: Some respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have \\nserious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups \\natincreased risk for severe illness. This includes infants, older adults, or those with \\nunderlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems. More than 200 respiratory \\nviruses can cause colds.Rhinovirusesare the most frequent cause of colds in the United \\nStates. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common \\nhuman coronaviruses,parainfluenza viruses,adenoviruses,enteroviruses(includingEV-D68), \\nandhuman metapneumovirus. SARS-CoV-2(the virus that causes COVID-19),influenza \\nvirus(the virus that causes flu), andrespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)can also cause cold-like \\nsymptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe \\nillness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu,get tested, \\nespecially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for \\nCOVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin. Different \\nrespiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through \\ndroplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can \\nenter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch \\nyour eyes, nose, or mouth.

Occupational exposure limits (OELs) indicate the maximum allowable concentration \\nof a chemical substance within the workplace. Levels at or above the OEL can increase the \\nrisk of workplace exposure. OELs include NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) \\nand OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs). Most chemicals in commercial use have not \\nbeen assigned an OEL. Repeated occupational exposure to a chemical, even below its OEL, \\nmay not lead to harmful health effects in most workers. Many commercially available \\nchemicals and chemical mixtures have not been assigned an OEL from an authoritative \\nsource. Workplace risks are grouped into control categories or ?bands? based on assessing \\nhazard and exposure information. A \"band of hazards\" might be: The potential for exposure \\n(low, medium, high) is also considered. The exposure potential includes the following \\nconsiderations: At the end of the control banding process, users have a proposed control \\nmeasure to implement (see example matrix). Control measures serve to decrease risk. \\nExamples of recommended control measures could be personal protective equipment, \\ndilution ventilation, engineering controls, containment, or some other hazard control. This \\napproach is based on two pillars: Control banding uses the solutions that experts have \\ndeveloped previously to control occupational chemical exposures and suggests applying \\nthem to other tasks with similar exposure situations. It is an approach that focuses \\nresources on exposure controls and describes how a risk needs to be managed. NIOSH \\nconsiders control banding to be a potentially useful tool for small businesses. Control \\nbanding is best used with thehierarchy of controls, which aims to protect workers by \\nreducing exposure to hazards in the workplace. For example, a hazardous chemical can be \\nsubstituted with a less hazardous chemical. It is important to note that control banding is \\nNOT a replacement for experts in occupational safety and health. Sometimes the control \\nbanding advice directly guides employers to seek expert guidance.

Prions trigger \\nnormal proteins in the body to misfold, leading to CJD. CJD causes dementia and other \\nneurologic problems. Once symptoms begin, it can lead to death in months to a year. Classic \\nCJD occurs worldwide in older adults, with the average age in the late 60s. Very few cases \\noccur in people who are younger than 30 years old. CJD occurs worldwide with an \\nestimated rate of about one to two illness per one million population members per year. In \\nrecent years in the United States, about 500-600 cases have been reported per year. There \\nare three main types of CJD infection: The vast majority of all CJD cases reported (about 85 \\npercent) are called sporadic. These types of cases occur when prion proteins already in the \\nbody misfold for some unknown reason. The result is disease that breaks down the brain\\'s \\nfunctions. Some cases are fatal within a few months of the first symptoms, and most are \\nfatal within a year. About 5-15 percent of CJD cases occur because the person has inherited \\na mutation in the prion protein gene. A person with CJD with a first-degree relative (parent, \\nsibling, or child) who also has the disease would have familial CJD. Iatrogenic cases are \\ncaused by contact with prions in a healthcare setting or due to biological products. There \\nhave been six known CJD cases caused by surgical or medical equipment contaminated with \\nprions is used on another patient. People who received prion-contaminated human growth \\nhormone prior to 1978 may also develop iatrogenic CJD. Even 50 years later, cases are still \\nbeing identified. Finally, cases can occur in people who receive a transplant of specific \\nmaterials. These include corneal (eye) grafts or dura mater (a membrane in the brain and \\nspinal cord) grafts. If the donor had CJD that was not discovered before the donation, \\nrecipients can contract CJD. People with CJD suffer from dementia. Other symptoms may \\ninclude trouble walking, sudden jerky movements, and visual disturbances. CJD patients \\nusually die within one year following the onset of symptoms. Healthcare providers can \\ndiagnose an illness as a suspect case based on: The only way to confirm CJD is through \\ntesting brain tissue from a biopsy or an autopsy. Classic CJD is always fatal, usually within a \\nfew months. There is unfortunately no therapy that will slow or stop the progression of \\ndisease. So, treatment involves supportive care to make the patient more comfortable. \\nThough they have very similar names, CJD and variant CJD (vCJD) are not the same disease. \\nBoth are prion diseases. However, variant CJD is tied to eating meat from cows infected with \\nbovine spongiform encephalopathy (sometimes called Mad Cow Disease). CJD, sometimes \\ncalled \"classic CJD\" to avoid confusion, mostly occurs sporadically. Unlike variant CJD, \\nclassic CJD is not caused by any other prion disease. In general, classic CJD affects people \\nolder than 55 while vCJD cases were younger, with an average age of 28. Classic CJD \\nprogresses much more quickly, causing death in an average of 4-5 months, while vCJD \\naverages more than a year.

BSE is sometimes called \"mad cow disease.\" vCJD was \\nfirst reported in the United Kingdom in 1996. Worldwide, there have been 233 people \\nreported to have vCJD since its discovery. The vast majority of illnesses occurred in the \\nUnited Kingdom in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There were also cases reported in \\nEurope, Asia, the Middle East, the United States and Canada. It can take years for someone \\nto develop vCJD symptoms after they were exposed to BSE. But, once symptoms begin, it is \\nalways fatal. Most people with vCJD live with the illness for one to two years, with an \\naverage time of 13-14 months. As with other prion diseases, it takes a long time for people \\nto get sick after contact with the prion. This timeframe can be 10 years or more. People with \\nvCJD have obvious psychiatric (mental, emotional, behavioral) symptoms. Often, this \\nincludes depression, anxiety and withdrawal. They may also have a painful condition called \\ndysesthesia. This may feel like itching, burning, pins and needles or other sensations on \\ntheir body. Later in the illness, patients typically have dementia and neurologic signs such \\nas poor coordination. Of the 233 vCJD illnesses reported since 1996, four vCJD illnesses \\nhave been reported in the United States. Three occurred between 2001 and 2006. A fourth \\nhad vCJD symptoms beginning in 2012. It is believed that all four people with vCJD in the \\nU.S. contracted the disease in another country. Two of the four patients had lived for \\ndecades in the United Kingdom. A third was born and raised in Saudi Arabia before coming \\nto the United States. It\\'s not clear where the fourth patient may have been exposed, but \\nexperts agreed it was likely outside the US. A few more recent vCJD illnesses occurred in lab \\npersonnel and may have been exposed to prions in the lab. There is strong evidence vCJD is \\ncaused when people eat meat from cows that were infected with Bovine Spongiform \\nEncephalopathy (BSE). BSE was first identified in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and \\ncases peaked in the early 1990s. The first vCJD cases were reported in 1996. Feeding cattle \\nmeat and bone meal from dead cows, some of which had BSE, contributed to the large U.K. \\noutbreak. Policies to prevent further exposure of animals and humans to BSE led to a \\ndramatic decline in BSE cases. These included animal feed bans and the removal of \\ninfectious cattle tissues, such as the brain, from human food. Scientists believe people may \\nhave eaten food potentially contaminated with BSE in the mid-1980s. vCJD cases started \\nappearing about 10 years later. This matches the usual incubation period (the time between \\nexposure and symptoms) for other prion diseases. Preventing vCJD primarily involves \\navoiding BSE. Given the how rare BSE is and protective measures in place, there are no \\nspecific  vCJD prevention measures needed now. There is no specific test to diagnose vCJD \\nwhile a patient is alive. Healthcare providers look at a number of factors when deciding if \\nsomeone has vCJD: To confirm the patient had vCJD, scientists must examine brain tissue \\ngathered during an autopsy.

CF affects about 35,000 people in the United States. People with CF \\nhave mucus that is too thick and sticky, which CF affects many different organs in the body, \\nmaking people with the disease more likely to develop other health conditions \\nincludingdiabetes,cirrhosis (liver disease),arthritis,reflux,hypersplenism(overactive \\nspleen), andosteoporosis. Signs of CF include Talk to your healthcare provider if you or your \\nchild shows signs of CF. Asweat testorgenetic testingmight be needed. If you or your child \\nhave been diagnosed with CF, you canfind a CF Care Center near you. CF results from \\ngenetic changes (mutations) in theCystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator \\n(CFTR) gene, which has instructions for making the CFTR protein. Everyone has two copies \\nof theCFTRgene, one copy inherited from their mother and one from their father. A person \\nmust have genetic changes in both copies of theCFTRgene to have CF. This means that \\nparents who each have a genetic change in only one copy of theCFTRgene, and therefore do \\nnot have the disorder themselves, can together have a child with CF. The American College \\nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends thatcarrier screeningfor genetic disorders, \\nincluding CF, be offered to anyone who is considering pregnancy or is currently pregnant. \\nHowever, this carrier screening does not include all possible CF genetic changes. Because CF \\nsometimes runs in families, if you have afamily historyof CF and decide to get screened, talk \\nto your healthcare provider to make sure that you are tested for the genetic change that \\nruns in your family. Your healthcare provider might refer you forgenetic \\ncounselingandtesting. All babies born in the United States are checked for CF soon after \\nbirth as part ofnewborn screening. Finding babies with CF early is important so that they \\ncan start treatment right away, which can help delay or prevent complications of the \\ndisorder. Some people with CF show signs of the disorder soon after birth, although in \\nmilder cases, signs might not be seen until adulthood. Available treatments can help people \\nwith CF live longer, healthier lives.Treatmentsfor CF focus on improving breathing and \\ndigestion, preventing and treating infections, and thinning mucus. Treatments include \\nmedicines, therapy to clear mucus out of the lungs, and in some cases, lung \\ntransplant.Pharmacogenomicapproaches have led to the development of medicines that \\ntarget the underlying cause of the disorder. Because differentCFTRgenetic changes have \\ndifferent effects on the CFTR protein, these medicines can only be used to treat people with \\ncertainCFTRgenetic changes.

This infection occurs after a person swallows tapeworm eggs. The larvae get into \\ntissues such as muscle, brain, and eye, and form cysts called cysticerci. When cysts are \\nfound in the brain or central nervous system, it is called neurocysticercosis. Signs and \\nsymptoms depend on the location and number of cysts in your body. Symptoms can occur \\nmonths to years after infection, usually when the cysts start dying. You get cysticercosis \\nwhen you swallow tapeworm (T. solium) eggs. The eggs are passed in the feces (poop) of \\nsomeone with a tapeworm. Tapeworm eggs can get in or on food, water, or surfaces \\ncontaminated with feces. People swallow the eggs when they consume contaminated food \\nor water or put contaminated fingers in their mouth. Autoinfection is when someone with a \\ntapeworm infects themselves with tapeworm eggs. They can also infect others in the family. \\nEating pork cannot give you cysticercosis. You can take steps to prevent cysticercosis. If you \\nthink that you may have cysticercosis, please see your healthcare provider. They will ask \\nyou about: Diagnosing neurocysticercosis typically involves MRI or CT brain scans and \\nsometimes blood tests. Blood tests might not show positive results in mild infections. If \\nsurgery is needed, a pathologist will examine the cyst for diagnosis. See additional \\ninformation on testing for intestinal tapeworm infections on thetaeniasissite. Infections are \\ngenerally treated with a combination of anti-parasitic drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs. \\nSurgery is sometimes necessary to treat cysts depending on: Treatment isn't always \\nnecessary for every case of cysticercosis.

Over half \\nof adults have been infected with CMV by age 40. Once CMV is in a person?s body, it stays \\nthere for life and can reactivate. A person can also be re-infected with a different strain of \\nthe virus. Most people with CMV show no signs or symptoms and aren?t aware that they \\nhave been infected. Sometimes, infection in healthy people can cause mild illness like: \\nOccasionally, CMV can causemononucleosisorhepatitis(liver problems). If you have a \\nweakened immune system and get CMV, you can have more serious symptoms affecting the \\neyes; lungs; liver; esophagus; stomach; and intestines. Babiesborn with CMVcan have brain, \\nliver, spleen, lung, and growth problems. The most common long-term health problem in \\nbabies born with CMV infection is hearing loss. This may be detected soon after birth or \\nmay develop later in childhood. Anyone can get CMV. Some people are at higher risk for \\ncomplications from CMV, like those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems. \\nIf you are pregnant and infected with CMV, you can pass CMV to your developing baby. \\nWhen a baby is born with a CMV infection, it is called congenital CMV. About 1 in 200 babies \\nis born with congenital CMV infection. About 1 in 5 babies with congenital CMV infection \\nwill have birth defects or other long-term health problems. The virus can stay in a child\\'s \\nbody fluids for months after the infection. People who are often around young children are \\nmore likely to get infected. People with CMV can pass the virus through body fluids, such as \\nsaliva, urine, blood, tears, semen, and breast milk. An infected person can spread CMV: You \\ncan lower your chances of getting CMV by reducing contact with saliva (spit) and urine from \\nbabies and young children. Make sure you: Healthcare providers can order blood tests to \\nidentify CMV infection in adults who have symptoms. However, blood is not the best fluid to \\ntest newborns with suspected CMV infection. Saliva or urine tests are preferred for \\nnewborns. These tests must be donewithin 2 to 3 weeksof birth to confirm if the baby has \\ncongenital CMV. Healthy people who are infected with CMV usually do not require medical \\ntreatment. Medications called antivirals are available to treat: Valganciclovir is an antiviral \\nthat might improve hearing and developmental outcomes in babies. It can have serious side \\neffects and has only been studied in babies with signs of congenital CMV infection. There is \\nlimited information on the effectiveness of valganciclovir to treat infants with hearing loss \\nalone. Children with congenital CMV should have regular hearing and vision checks. There \\nare other services a child may need to help them develop strong language and \\ncommunications skills. CDC aims to reduce the burden of congenital CMV.  We work closely \\nwith national experts to conduct research and increase awareness of CMV among the public \\nand healthcare providers. Specific activities include: In 2011, Congress passed a resolution \\nnaming June \"National CMV Awareness Month,\" to raise awareness about the most common \\ninfectious cause of birth defects. During this time, CDC offers resources to increase \\nunderstanding of CMV and congenital CMV among healthcare providers, pregnant women, \\nand parents. ?The National Congenital CMV Disease Registry assists nearly 600 families \\naffected by CMV by providing a way to exchange information and by offering help and \\nsupport to one another. CMV is the most common infectious cause of birth defects in the \\nUnited States. It can spread through body fluids like saliva and urine, especially by children.

These factors include genetics; parental health and behaviors (such as \\nsmoking and drinking) during pregnancy; complications during birth; infections the mother \\nmight have during pregnancy or the baby might have very early in life; and exposure of the \\nmother or child to high levels of environmental toxins, such as lead. For some \\ndevelopmental disabilities, such as fetal alcohol syndrome, which is caused by drinking \\nalcohol during pregnancy, we know the cause. But for most, we don?t. Following are some \\nexamples of what we know about specific developmental disabilities: The Study to Explore \\nEarly Development (SEED) is a multiyear study funded by CDC. It is currently the largest \\nstudy in the United States to help identify factors that may put children at risk for autism \\nspectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities. Developmental disabilities occur \\namong all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Recent estimates in the United States \\nshow that about 1 in 6, or about 17%, of children aged 3 through 17 years have one or more \\ndevelopmental disabilities, such as For more than a decade, CDC?s Autism and \\nDevelopmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network has been tracking the number and \\ncharacteristics of children with autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, and intellectual \\ndisability in several diverse communities throughout the United States. Children and adults \\nwith disabilities need health care and health programs for the same reasons anyone else \\ndoes?to stay well, active, and a part of the community. Having a disability does not mean a \\nperson is not healthy or that he or she cannot be healthy. Being healthy means the same \\nthing for all of us?getting and staying well so we can lead full, active lives. That includes \\nhaving the tools and information to make healthy choices and knowing how to prevent \\nillness. Some health conditions, such as asthma, gastrointestinal symptoms, eczema and \\nskin allergies, and migraine headaches, have been found to be more common among \\nchildren with developmental disabilities. Thus, it is especially important for children with \\ndevelopmental disabilities to see a health care provider regularly. CDC does not study \\neducation or treatment programs for people with developmental disabilities, nor does it \\nprovide direct services to people with developmental disabilities or to their families. \\nHowever, CDC has put together a list of resources for people affected by developmental \\ndisabilities.

It does this by causing irritation to the \\neyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin. Several different compounds are riot control agents: \\nRiot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used \\nby individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray). \\nCS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use \\ntheir gas masks. Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for \\nexample, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure. The effects usually only last 15 to 30 \\nminutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off. The level of poisoning \\ndepends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how \\nlong. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors). People exposed \\nto riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately \\nafter exposure: Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects \\nsuch as: Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has \\nbeen exposed to riot control agents. Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or \\nsolids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets \\nor particles. If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin \\ncontact, eye contact, or breathing them in. Since breathing in riot control agents is the \\nprimary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where \\nfresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents. If the riot \\ncontrol agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were \\nreleased. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the \\nhighest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel \\nclose to the ground. If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building. \\nIf you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you toevacuate the areaor \"shelter in \\nplace\" inside. Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it \\nover the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas. Wash any riot control \\nagents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will \\nprotect you from any chemicals on your body.

Other symptoms can include loss of appetite, \\nweight loss, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. It is unclear howD. fragilisspreads. Most likely, \\npeople get infected by accidentally swallowing the parasite; this is called fecal-oral \\ntransmission. This could be through contaminated food or water, person-to-person, or \\nanimal fecal (poop) contact. TheD. fragilisparasite is fragile and cannot live very long in the \\nenvironment (after it passes in feces) or in stomach acid (after it is swallowed). To prevent \\ninfection withD. fragilis, Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and \\nexamine it forD. fragilisinfection. You may have to submit stool samples from more than one \\nday as the parasite is not in every sample. People infected withD. fragiliscan also have \\npinworm eggs.

These actions can '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 219, 'page_label': '302'}, page_content='help to decrease mortality and morbidity and improve prevention and mitigation strategies \\nfor future disasters. Typically, the main objectives of disaster epidemiology are the \\nfollowing: State, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) health departments should look first at \\nthe tools they are using in non-disaster settings to assess their applicability for adaption to \\na disaster response. CDC provides various tools for public health disaster response \\nincluding template forms for morbidity surveillance, mortality surveillance, shelter \\nassessments, and theCommunity Assessment for Public Health Emergency \\nResponse,CASPER toolkit. CDC provides scientific consultation, technical assistance, and \\ndisaster epidemiology training to STLT, federal, and international public health partners to \\nhelp them respond to natural and human-induced disasters. There are several ways you can \\nrequest CDC assistance. If you would like more information on CDC consultation, technical \\nassistance, or disaster epidemiology training, pleasevisit the training and technical \\nassistance webpage. Public health surveillance is the systematic collection, analysis, and \\ninterpretation of deaths, injuries, and illnesses to provide information about any adverse \\nhealth effects related to a disaster event in a community. It allows us to assess the human \\nhealth impacts of a disaster and evaluate potential problems related to planning and \\nprevention. Public health morbidity surveillance allows us to detect disease outbreaks and \\ntrack disease and injury trends. A common myth is that epidemics are inevitable during a \\ndisaster. Early detection and response, however, can lessen the likelihood for outbreaks. \\nAdditionally, conducting health surveillance allows public health leaders and decision \\nmakers to make informed decisions about action items such as allocating resources, \\ntailoring interventions to meet specific needs, and planning for future disasters. In addition \\nto public health morbidity surveillance, mortality surveillance can provide information that \\ncan prevent excess death. The number of deaths is a strong indicator of the impact of the \\ndisaster. Disasters can overwhelm local medical examiners and emergency systems, \\ndisrupting typical reporting methods. Most mortality surveillance data (such as Vital \\nStatistics) are collected in a way that is not timely or detailed enough to be useful for \\ndisaster response. Thus, implementing active mortality surveillance following a disaster \\nprovides a critical aspect to response. CDC has several ready-to-use templates for morbidity \\nand mortality surveillance. These tools can supplement existing surveillance systems or \\nreplace surveillance systems that have been hindered or destroyed due to a disaster. For \\nmore information, review theTools and Resourcespage. During disasters, several steps may \\nneed to be conducted simultaneously when planning a surveillance system. Just as purpose \\nand objective should be clear in any disaster response effort, the surveillance system should \\nhave well-defined objectives. Additionally, data sources need to be identified and selected. \\nFacility-based surveillance of hospitals and emergency medical operations can provide \\ninformation on those seeking care during a disaster, yet there is often the need to use \\nadditional nontraditional sources of information (such as a shelters, pharmacies, or \\nphysician offices) as well. Ideally, data collection instruments for surveillance should be \\ndeveloped, tested, and distributed before the disaster occurs (e.g., CDC-developed \\nsurveillance tools). However, these instruments will need to be modified for each disaster \\nand location. The data collection instrument should collect only the most essential \\ninformation and should have easy data entry. For information to be useful, it must be '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 220, 'page_label': '303'}, page_content='disseminated in a timely fashion through appropriate channels (e.g., public health and other \\ngovernment officials, relief workers, the affected community, and the media). The \\nCommunity Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) is a type of rapid \\nneeds assessment (RNA). The assessment is designed to provide public health leaders and \\nemergency managers with household-based information about a community. It is quick, \\nreliable, relatively inexpensive, and flexible. CASPER uses valid statistical methods to gather \\ninformation. They can be conducted throughout the disaster cycle (preparedness, response, \\nrecovery, mitigation) and in non-disaster situations. The information generated can be used \\nto: Public health disaster studies help identify associations between disasters and mortality \\nor morbidity. It can also help evaluate programs or response techniques to yield decisions \\nand assess the successfulness of the program or response. CDC conducts epidemiologic \\nstudies and research on various disaster-related topics. Our subject matter experts also \\nprovide technical assistance to partners in conducting their own research.

Dogs and cats getDipylidiumtapeworm by \\nswallowing a flea infected with a tapeworm larvae, often while grooming themselves. The \\nlarval tapeworm will then develop into an adult tapeworm in the animal's intestine. People \\ngetDipylidiumtapeworm the same way dogs and cats do, by swallowing a flea infected with \\ntapeworm larvae. The adult tapeworm is made up of many small segments called \\nproglottids. Each proglottid is about the size of a grain of rice. Adult tapeworms may \\nmeasure 4 ? 28 inches in length. As the tapeworm grows inside the intestine, these \\nsegments (proglottids) break off and pass in the stool. Most dogs and cats infected \\nwithDipylidiumtapeworm do not show signs of illness. However, you can sometimes see the \\nproglottids crawling near the animal's anus (butt) or on the surface of a fresh bowel \\nmovement. Dried out proglottids look like grains of rice: they are small, about 2 mm, hard, \\nand yellowish in color. You can sometimes see them stuck to the fur around your pet's butt. \\nMost people infected withDipylidiumtapeworms also do not show signs of illness. It is more \\nlikely that you will recognize aDipylidiuminfection when you see tapeworm segments in \\nyour or your child's feces (poop). Dogs and cats getDipylidiumtapeworm by swallowing a \\nflea infected with a tapeworm larvae, often while grooming themselves. The larval \\ntapeworm will then develop into an adult tapeworm in the animal's intestines. The \\nsegments of the adult tapeworm, proglottids, break off and pass in the animal's stool. The \\nproglottids contain tapeworm eggs. Once the proglottid dries out, the eggs release into the \\nenvironment. Flea larvae then feed on theDipylidiumeggs and start the cycle over again. \\nPeople getDipylidiumtapeworm the same way dogs and cats do, by swallowing a flea \\ninfected with tapeworm larvae. Most reported cases are in children. The most effective way \\nto preventDipylidiuminfection in pets and people is through flea control. Other ways to \\nprevent infection include Your veterinarian will not typically findDipylidiumtapeworm eggs \\nin a routine fecal (poop) exam. They rely on the pet's owner to notice the tapeworm \\nsegments (proglottids) crawling around the anus or in the pet's feces. Most infections in \\npeople are diagnosed clinically. This means your healthcare provider will look for the \\ntapeworm segments around a person's anus or in their feces. Your healthcare provider may \\nalso do a stool exam to look for eggs or tapeworm segments. Treatment is simple and very \\neffective for both animals and people. If you think your pet hasDipylidiumtapeworms, talk \\nto your veterinarian about treating your pet. When people haveDipylidiuminfection, their \\nhealthcare provider can prescribe praziquantel to treat the infection. The medication is \\nwell-tolerated and causes the tapeworm to dissolve within the intestine.

Children are more likely than \\nadults to be bitten by a dog. The injuries from dog bites in children also tend to be more \\nsevere. Most dog bites affecting young children occur during everyday activities and while \\ninteracting with familiar dogs. Having a dog in the household is linked to a higher likelihood \\nof being bitten than not having a dog. As the number of dogs in the home increases, so does \\nthe likelihood of being bitten. Adults with two or more dogs in the household are five times \\nmore likely to be bitten. This is comparison to people living without dogs at home. Among \\nadults, men are more likely than women to be bitten by a dog. Do not disturb a dog while it \\nis eating, sleeping, or caring for puppies. Do not pet a dog if it appears to be hiding or seeing \\ntime alone. Do not continue petting a dog if it seems scared, sick, or angry. If a dog knocks \\nyou over, curl into a ball.

Infection is transmitted by mosquito bites. There are many species ofDirofilaria, \\nbut human infection is caused most commonly by three species,D. immitis,D. repens, andD. \\ntenuis. The main natural hosts for these three species are dogs and wild canids, such as \\nfoxes and wolves (D. immitisandD. repens) and raccoons (D. tenuis).D. immitisis also known \\nas \"heartworm.\"D. repensis not found in the United States, andD. tenuisappears to be \\nrestricted to raccoons in North America. Dirofilariasis is the disease caused \\nbyDirofilariaworm infections. In dogs, one form is called \"heartworm disease\" and is caused \\nbyD. immitis.D. immitisadult worms can cause pulmonary artery blockage in dogs, leading \\nto an illness that can include cough, exhaustion upon exercise, fainting, coughing up blood, \\nand severe weight loss. Human infections withD. immitiscan result in areas of inflammation \\ninduced by dying adult worms in pulmonary arteries that appear as coin lesions on chest x-\\nrays. Coin lesions can also be caused by cancer and other serious diseases, and a coin lesion \\ndiscovered accidentally on chest x-ray usually leads to an invasive procedure to learn the \\ncause. Most human cases of pulmonary dirofilariasis are diagnosed from samples taken \\nduring these procedures. Most reported cases ofD. immitisinfection in humans have been in \\npersons with no symptoms. People with symptoms can have cough (including coughing up \\nblood), chest pain, fever, and pleural effusion (excess fluid between the tissues that line the \\nlungs and the chest cavity). Rarely,D. immitisworms have been found in humans at outside \\nthe lungs, including the brain, eye, and testicle. WhenD. repensandD. tenuisinfection is '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 226, 'page_label': '309'}, page_content='reported in humans, it is generally as the cause of nodules under the skin, but on occasion, \\nworms are found in the conjunctiva. Dirofilariasis is found throughout the world \\nwhereDirofilariaspecies are common. In the United States, canine dirofilariasis has been \\nreported from all states, andD. tenuisin raccoons is common in many areas where raccoons \\nare found. Canine and human dirofilariasis are most prevalent in eastern and southeastern \\nstates, although rates are increasing rapidly in a number of western states.D. immitisis \\ntheDirofilariaspecies most commonly reported to cause dirofilariasis in humans in the \\nUnited States.D. repensis theDirofilariaspecies most commonly reported to cause \\ndirofilariasis among humans in Europe. One or both of these species have been found to \\ncause human dirofilariasis in other parts of the world. The definitive mammalian hosts \\nforDirofilariaare primarily domestic dogs, wild canids (such as wolves and foxes), and \\nraccoons. In these hosts, sexually mature worms produce microfilariae that circulate in the \\nblood and are ingested by mosquitoes during a blood meal. In mosquitoes, the microfilariae \\ndevelop into larvae that migrate to the proboscis (the long, tubular part of the mouth of the \\nmosquito that punctures the skin during a blood meal), where they are ready to infect \\nanother host during a blood meal. Several types of mosquitoes are capable of \\ntransmittingDirofilariainfection, includingAedes,Anopheles, andMansonia. Humans and a \\nwide range of other mammals are accidental hosts that play no role in the transmission \\nofDirofilaria. In these hosts,Dirofilarialarvae can develop into adult worms but the worms \\nremain sexually immature and no microfilariae are produced. Dirofilariasis can be \\nprevented by avoiding mosquito bites in areas where mosquitoes may be infected \\nwithDirofilarialarvae. The risk of such mosquito bites can be reduced by leaving as little \\nskin exposed as possible, by the use of insect repellent when exposed to mosquitoes, and by \\nsleeping under an insecticide-treated bednet in areas whereDirofilaria-infected mosquitoes \\nbite at night and have access to sleeping areas. In humans, dirofilariasis is diagnosed most \\nfrequently by the examination of tissue from areas of inflammation in the lung obtained as \\npart of the diagnostic investigation of coin lesions (small, round abnormalities) on chest x-\\nrays or from the examination of tissue in nodules under the skin. Blood tests are not yet \\nhelpful in the diagnosis of dirofilariasis in humans. The definitive treatment \\nofDirofilariainfection in humans is surgical removal of lung granulomas and nodules under \\nthe skin; this treatment is also curative. In many cases, no treatment with medicines is \\nnecessary. This information is not meant to be used for self-diagnosis or as a substitute for \\nconsultation with a health care provider. If you have any questions about the parasites \\ndescribed above or think that you may have a parasitic infection, consult a health care \\nprovider.

Intimate partner refers to both current and former spouses and \\ndating partners. IPV can vary in how often it happens and how severe it is. It can range from \\none episode of violence to chronic and severe episodes over multiple years. IPV can include \\nany of the following types of behavior:1 For more information about IPV definitions please \\nseeIntimate Partner Violence Surveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Data \\nElements, Version 2.0.

About 16 million women \\nand 11 million men who reported experiencing intimate partner violence in their lifetime \\nsaid that they first experienced it before age 18.2 While violence impacts all people, some \\nindividuals and communities experience inequities in risk for violence due to the social and \\nstructural conditions in which they live, work, and play. Youth from groups that have been \\nmarginalized, such as sexual and gender minority youth, are at greater risk of experiencing \\nsexual and physical dating violence.34 Intimate partner violence can result in injuries and \\neven death. Data from U.S. crime reports suggest that about one in five homicide victims are \\nkilled by an intimate partner. The reports also found that over half of female homicide \\nvictims are killed by a current or former male intimate partner.5 Many other negative \\nhealth outcomes are associated with intimate partner violence. These include conditions \\naffecting the heart, muscles and bones, and digestive, reproductive, and nervous systems, \\nmany of which are chronic.5 Survivors can experience mental health problems such as \\ndepression and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. They are at higher risk for \\nengaging in behaviors such as smoking, binge drinking, and risky sexual activity.6People \\nfrom groups that have been marginalized, such as people from racial and ethnic minority \\ngroups, are at higher risk for worse consequences.7 Although the personal consequences of \\nintimate partner violence are devastating, there are also many costs to society. The lifetime \\neconomic cost associated with medical services for IPV-related injuries, lost productivity \\nfrom paid work, criminal justice and other costs, is $3.6 trillion. The cost of IPV over a \\nvictim?s lifetime was $103,767 for women and $23,414 for men.8 Intimate partner violence \\ncan be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or \\nexperiencing intimate partner violence. Preventing intimate partner violence requires \\nunderstanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from \\nviolence.6 Promoting healthy, respectful, and nonviolent relationships and communities can \\nhelp reduce the occurrence of intimate partner violence.

An older adult is someone aged 60 or older. The \\nabuse occurs at the hands of a caregiver or other trusted person. Common types of abuse \\ninclude:1 For more information about elder abuse definitions please seeElder Abuse \\nSurveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Core Data Elements. The older adult \\npopulation is growing faster in the U.S. than are younger populations. The data \\nunderestimate the problem because the number of nonfatal injuries is limited to older \\nadults who are treated in emergency departments. The information doesn?t include those \\ntreated by other providers or those that do not need or do not seek treatment. Additionally, \\nmany cases are not reported because the older adult is afraid or unable to tell police, \\nfriends, or family about the violence. Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is \\nexperienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home.2From 2002 to 2016, more than \\n643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and \\nover 19,000 homicides occurred.3 Compared with women, men had higher rates of both \\nnonfatal assaults and homicides.34The rate for nonfatal assaults increased more than 75% \\namong men (2002?2016) and more than 35% among women (2007?2016). The estimated \\nhomicide rate for men increased 7% from 2010 to 2016.3Compared to non-Hispanic \\nWhites, non-Hispanic Black or African American persons, non-Hispanic American \\nIndian/Alaskan Natives, and Hispanic or Latino persons have higher homicide rates \\n(2002?2016).3 Overall and firearm-specific older adult homicide rates increased between \\n2014 and 2017. Of the 6,188 victims, 62% were male. The perpetrator was an intimate \\npartner in 39% of firearm homicides and 12% of non-firearm homicides. Common contexts \\nof firearm homicides were familial or intimate partner problems, robbery or burglary, \\nargument, and illness-related (e.g. the homicide was perpetrated to end the suffering of an \\nill victim, both victim and perpetrator had an illness, or the perpetrator had a mental \\nillness).4 The economic cost of violent injuries against older adults is also substantial. A \\nrecent CDC study found that assault injuries to older adults in the United States cost almost \\n$33 billion in 2022. This reflects a rise in both homicides and nonfatal assaults treated in \\nemergency departments among older adults. Specifically, the rate of nonfatal assaults \\nincreased by 31%, while the rate of homicides rose by 26% between 2015 and 2022.5 \\nAbuse can have several physical and emotional effects on an older adult. Victims are fearful \\nand anxious.

Despite how \\ncommon the bacteria are, they usually don't make people sick. In the United States, about 5-\\n10 cases per state are reported each year. This averages to 250-500 infections nationally \\nper year. Most infections occur in small outbreaks in health care facilities in people who \\nhave pre-existing health conditions.

The other is that most people with Elizabethkingia are already medically \\nfragile before they get Elizabethkingia. Elizabethkingia signs and symptoms of illness vary. \\nThe most common symptom is blood infections without an obvious source. Meningitis \\n(swelling of the brain and nervous system) is common.

Reports of \\nmpox are rising in Africa where the disease is endemic and in new countries where the \\ndisease has not been previously seen. The 2022 global outbreak of clade II mpox and an \\nongoing outbreak of the more lethal clade I mpox highlight the pandemic potential for \\nmonkeypox virus. Waning population immunity after the cessation of routine immunization \\nfor smallpox plays a key role in the changing epidemiologic patterns of mpox. Sustained \\nhuman-to-human transmission of mpox is occurring widely in the context of insufficient \\npopulation immunity, fueling genetic mutations that affect the accuracy of some diagnostic \\ntests and that could lead to changing virulence. Additional research should address complex \\nchallenges for control of mpox, including improved diagnostics and medical \\ncountermeasures. The availability of vaccines should be expanded not only for outbreak \\nresponse but also for broader routine use for persons in mpox-endemic countries. We \\ndescribe an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused byNeisseria \\nmeningitidisserogroup C in Fiji.

We conducted a systematic review examining 30 reported \\ncases of avian influenza in pregnant women. We found high mortality rates for mothers \\n(90.0%, 27/30) and their babies (86.7%, 26/30) when women were infected with avian \\ninfluenza virus during pregnancy. Despite being a high-risk population and having worse \\nhealth outcomes across multiple pandemics, pregnant women are often excluded from \\nvaccine trials. However, as the risk for a new pandemic increases and human vaccines \\nagainst avian influenza are developed, early inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials \\ncan inform the risk?benefit analysis for both the mother and their newborn infant. Early \\ninclusion of pregnant women in public health vaccination programs is vital for protecting \\nthis high-risk population. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \\ncirculates in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula and occasionally causes spillover \\ninfections in humans. MERS-CoV diversity is poorly understood because of the lack of \\nsampling during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected 558 swab samples from dromedary \\ncamels in Saudi Arabia during November 2023?January 2024. We found 39% were positive \\nfor MERS-CoV RNA by reverse transcription PCR. We sequenced 42 MERS-CoVs and 7 \\nhuman 229E-related coronaviruses from camel swab samples by using high-throughput \\nsequencing. Sequences from both viruses formed monophyletic clades apical to recently \\navailable genomes. MERS-CoV sequences were most similar to B5 lineage sequences and \\nharbored unique genetic features, including novel amino acid polymorphisms in the spike \\nprotein. Further characterization will be required to understand their effects. MERS-CoV \\nspillover into humans poses considerable public health concerns.

We collected social contact data in Greece to measure contact patterns \\nbefore (January 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020?October 2021) and \\nassess the effects of social distancing over time. During lockdowns, mean daily contacts \\ndecreased to 2.8?5.9 (mean prepandemic 20.4). Persons>65 years of age retained the fewest \\ncontacts during the pandemic (2.1?4.1). Compared with the first lockdown (March?April \\n2020), the second lockdown (November?December 2020) and third lockdown (April 2021) \\nshowed higher numbers of contacts (incidence rate ratio 1.50 [95% CI 1.27?1.76] in second \\nlockdown and 2.19 [95% CI 1.86?2.58] in third lockdown). In 2021, an increase in contacts \\nwas apparent, which persisted during the April 2021 lockdown among persons 18?64 years \\nof age.

Neisseria meningitidisis a common commensal bacterium of the \\nnasopharynx that can cause invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). In comparison,N. \\ngonorrhoeaeis always a pathogen usually limited to mucosal sites. However, increased \\nevidence for overlapping clinical syndromes is emerging. We \\ncomparedN.meningitidissamples from a urogenital outbreak in Australia with sequences \\nfrom the United States and other countries. We conducted phylogenetic analyses to assess \\nrelatedness and examine for genomic changes associated with meningococcal adaptation; \\nwe collated a total of 255 serogroup Y (MenY), sequence type (ST) 1466 isolate assemblies. \\nMost urogenital isolates originated from Australia; those isolates formed a distinct clade, \\nmost closely related genomically to recent US IMD isolates. No specific genomic changes \\nsuggested niche adaptation or associated clinical manifestations. The MenY \\nST1466N.meningitidisisolates circulating in Australia and the United States are capable of \\ncausing both urethritis and invasive meningococcal disease. Few sources have reported \\nempirical social contact data from resource-poor settings. To address this shortfall, we \\nrecruited 1,363 participants from rural and urban areas of Mozambique during the COVID-\\n19 pandemic, determining age, sex, and relation to the contact for each person. Participants \\nreported a mean of 8.3 (95% CI 8.0?8.6) contacts per person. The mean contact rates were \\nhigher in the rural site compared with the urban site (9.8 vs 6.8; p<0.01). Using \\nmathematical models, we noted higher vaccine effects in the rural site when comparing \\nempirical (32%) with synthetic (29%) contact matrices and lower corresponding vaccine \\neffects in the urban site (32% vs 35%). Those effects were prominent in younger (0?9 \\nyears) and older (?60 years) persons. Our work highlights the importance of empirical data, \\nshowing differences in contact rates and patterns between rural and urban sites in \\nMozambique and their nonnegligible effects in modeling potential effects of vaccine \\ninterventions.

Since \\n2016, epizootics of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus have threatened the \\npoultry sector in Europe. Because conventional prevention and control measures alone \\nwere insufficient in some contexts, the European Commission authorized poultry \\nvaccination in 2023. Subsequently, France launched a nationwide duck vaccination \\ncampaign combined with a comprehensive surveillance plan. We used a mathematical \\nmodel to simulate the transmission of HPAI viruses in vaccinated duck flocks and assess the \\neffectiveness of a wide range of surveillance strategies. Sampling and testing dead ducks \\nevery week (enhanced passive surveillance) was the most sensitive (?90%) and the most \\ntimely strategy. Active surveillance through monthly testing of a cross-sectional sample of \\nlive ducks was the least sensitive and timely strategy. Thus, we advise focusing HPAI \\nsurveillance efforts on enhanced passive surveillance and reducing active surveillance of \\nlive ducks. Cefiderocol (FDC), a siderophore-cephalosporin conjugate, is the newest option \\nfor treating infection with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria. We identified a \\nnovel mechanism contributing to decreased FDC susceptibility inKlebsiella \\npneumoniaeclinical isolates. The mechanism involves 2 coresident plasmids: pKpQIL, \\ncarrying variants ofblaKPCcarbapenemase gene, and pKPN, carrying the ferric citrate \\ntransport (FEC) system.

Using a prion amplification assay, we identified prions in tissues from wild pigs \\n(Sus scrofa) living in areas of the United States with variable chronic wasting disease (CWD) \\nepidemiology. Our findings indicate that scavenging swine could play a role in \\ndisseminating CWD and could therefore influence its epidemiology, geographic distribution, \\nand interspecies spread. To trace evolution of Panton-Valentine leucocidin?positive clonal \\ncomplex 398 methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) in the Czech Republic, we \\ntested 103 MRSA isolates from humans. Five (4.9%) were Panton-Valentine \\nleucocidin?positive clonal complex 398, sequence types 1232 and 9181. Spread to the Czech \\nRepublic may result from travel to or from other countries.

Although imperfect, the detection of all 5 of the biomarkersiucA,iroB,peg-\\n344,rmpA, andrmpA2is the most accurate and pragmatic means to identify hvKp. We \\npropose a working definition for hvKp that will enhance accuracy for diagnosis and \\nsurveillance, which will aid in preventing the spread of hvKp. Event management systems \\n(EMS) are key tools for epidemic intelligence, integrating surveillance signals and incident \\nresponse, although international standards to inform development are lacking. We describe \\nthe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) SITAware, a software capable \\nof operating with low internet bandwidth to generate notifications, reports, and \\nspatiotemporal dashboards and provide event-level data for real-time accountability and \\npostevent learning. SITAware was enabled by local institutional ownership, co-created at \\nlow cost, and integrated into existing workflows. In 2022, SITAware was used to manage \\n?300 incidents, and NCDC implemented it subnationally.

Since the severe acute \\nrespiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, China has invested substantial efforts in promoting \\nscientific and technological advances for medical countermeasures against high-threat \\npathogens. The examination of China?s landscape identifies progress and gaps in research \\nand development (R&D) and also highlights management and regulatory issues that should \\nbe of concern to other countries. Our study examined the current state of R&D of medical \\ncountermeasures in China during 1990?2022. The findings showed a robust and diversified \\npipeline responding quickly to disease outbreaks and policy changes. However, proactive \\nand highly innovative candidates are limited, and a large proportion of vaccines and drugs \\nstagnate at the early development stage. A paradigm shift involving a preemptive R&D \\nagenda and persistent investment, innovative technology development, and accelerated \\nresearch translation is urgently needed to prepare for the next pandemic. Disclaimer: Early \\nrelease articles are not considered as final versions. Any changes will be reflected in the \\nonline version in the month the article is officially released. JYNNEOS, a third-generation \\nsmallpox vaccine, is integral to monkeypox virus (MPXV) control efforts, but the durability \\nof this modified vaccinia Ankara?Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) vaccine?s effectiveness is \\nundefined. We optimized and used a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) with \\nauthentic clade IIa MPXV and vaccinia virus to assess antibody responses over 12 months in \\n8 donors vaccinated with 2 doses of JYNNEOS. One donor previously received the \\nACAM2000 vaccine; 7 donors were smallpox vaccine?naive. IgG responses of the donors to \\nvaccinia virus (L1, B5, and A33) or MPXV (E8, H3, A35) antigens and PRNT titers to both \\nviruses peaked at 8 weeks postvaccination and waned rapidly thereafter in naive donors. \\nMPXV PRNT titers were especially low; no naive donors demonstrated 90% plaque \\nreduction. These data indicate a need for improved correlates of MPXV immunity to enable \\nMVA-BN durability studies, given that recent clinical data support MVA-BN vaccine efficacy \\nagainst MPXV despite low antibody responses. We conducted 4 years of epidemiologic and \\ngenomic surveillance of single-dose effectiveness of a killed whole-cell oral cholera vaccine \\n(kOCV) andVibrio choleraetransmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We \\nenrolled 1,154 patients with diarrhea; 342 of those had culture-confirmed cholera. We \\nperformed whole-genome sequencing on clinical and waterV. choleraeisolates from 200 \\npatient households, which showed annual bimodal peaks ofV. choleraeclade AFR10e \\ninfections. A large clonal cholera outbreak occurred 14 months after a kOCV campaign of >1 \\nmillion doses, likely because of low (9%) vaccine coverage in informal settlements. Clinical \\nand water isolates collected in the same household were closely related, suggesting person-\\nto-person and water-to-person transmission. Single-dose kOCV vaccine effectiveness 24 \\nmonths after vaccination was 59.8% (95% CI 19.7%?79.9%), suggesting modest single-dose \\nkOCV protection. kOCV campaigns combined with water, sanitation, and hygiene programs \\nshould be used to reduce cholera in disease-endemic settings worldwide. White-tailed deer \\n(Odocoileus virginianus) have high value for research, conservation, agriculture, and \\nrecreation and might be key SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs. In November 2023, we sampled 15 \\nfemale deer in a captive facility in Texas, USA. All deer had neutralizing antibodies to SARS-\\nCoV-2; respiratory swab samples from 11 deer were SARS-CoV-2?positive by quantitative \\nreverse transcription PCR, and 1 deer also had a positive rectal swab sample. Six of the 11 '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 259, 'page_label': '342'}, page_content='respiratory swab samples yielded infectious virus; replication kinetics of most samples \\ndisplayed lower growth 24?48 hours postinfection in vitro than Omicron lineages isolated \\nfrom humans in Texas in the same period. Virus growth was similar between groups by 72 \\nhours, suggesting no strong attenuation of deer-derived virus. All deer viruses clustered in \\nXBB Omicron clade and demonstrated more mutations than expected compared with \\ncontemporaneous viruses in humans, suggesting that crossing the species barrier was \\naccompanied by a high substitution rate. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging \\nprion disease in Nordic countries and has been detected in reindeer, moose, and red deer \\nsince 2016. CWD sporadically detected in moose and red deer in 3 Nordic countries \\ndemonstrated pathologic and strain characteristics different from CWD in reindeer, \\nincluding an unexpected lack of prions outside the central nervous system as measured by \\nstandard diagnostic tests. Using protein misfolding cyclic amplification, we detected prions \\nin the lymphoreticular system of moose and red deer with CWD in Norway and, remarkably, \\nin muscles of both of those species and in CWD-infected reindeer. One moose lymph node \\nand 1 moose muscle sample showed infectivity when experimentally transmitted to bank \\nvoles. Our findings highlight the systemic nature of CWD strains in Europe and raise \\nquestions regarding the risk of human exposure through edible tissues. Indirect \\nimmunofluorescence antibody assays have been the primary method for laboratory \\ndiagnosis of ehrlichiosis. Detection ofEhrlichiaspp. DNA by using PCR is now widely \\navailable through commercial laboratories. To prepare forEhrlichiaspp. PCR introduction, \\nwe assessed ehrlichiosis testing practices, quantified the proportion of samples eligible for \\nPCR testing, and estimated the potential effect of implementing PCR at the University of \\nNorth Carolina health system in North Carolina, USA, which is in an area with a high-\\nincidence of ehrlichiosis. We found <1% of patient samples underwent PCR testing, even \\nthough rates of serodiagnostic algorithm completion (testing of acute and convalescent \\nsamples) were low (18.4%). Our findings show a need to educate providers on diagnostic \\nand treatment guidelines for ehrlichiosis and raise awareness of the availability and \\nadvantage of PCR testing. After the 2022?2023 Sudan virus (SUDV) disease outbreak in \\nUganda, we studied SUDV persistence in nonhuman primates that had survived acute \\ninfection without therapeutic intervention. We identified SUDV persistence in the vitreous \\nchamber and immediately adjacent tissue in the eyes as well as in the seminiferous tubules \\nin the testes but not in common target organs typically infected during the acute phase of \\ndisease. Specifically, SUDV persists primarily in macrophages in the eyes and Sertoli cells in \\nthe testes. Ocular and testicular SUDV persistence in nonhuman primates is accompanied by \\ntissue damage, including inflammatory cell invasion. Our study suggests that long-term \\nfollow-up efforts are needed to reduce possible recrudescent disease and reignition of \\noutbreaks caused by virus persistence in human survivors of SUDV infection. Epidemic \\nsurveillance using traditional approaches is dependent on case ascertainment and is \\ndelayed. Open-source intelligence (OSINT)?based syndromic surveillance can overcome \\nlimitations of delayed surveillance and poor case ascertainment, providing early warnings \\nto guide outbreak response. It can identify outbreaks of unknown cause for which no other \\nglobal surveillance exists. Using the artificial intelligence?based OSINT early warning \\nsystem EPIWATCH, we describe the global epidemiology of 310 outbreaks of unknown '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 260, 'page_label': '343'}, page_content='cause that occurred December 31, 2019?January 1, 2023. The outbreaks were associated \\nwith 75,968 reported human cases and 4,235 deaths. We identified where OSINT signaled \\noutbreaks earlier than official sources and before diagnoses were made. We identified \\npossible signals of known disease outbreaks with poor case ascertainment. A cause was \\nsubsequently reported for only 14% of outbreaks analyzed; the percentage was \\nsubstantially lower in lower/upper-middle?income economies than high-income \\neconomies, highlighting the utility of OSINT-based syndromic surveillance for early \\nwarnings, particularly in resource-poor settings. After termination of a control program in \\n2004,Echinococcus granulosusinfections have reemerged in Magallanes Region, Chile. \\nPrevalence in sheep >2 years of age in 2023 resembled levels observed at the start of the \\nprogram. Resurgence underscores the need for continued surveillance, particularly in \\nyounger sheep, to monitor recent transmission trends. A previously healthy 26-year-old \\nwoman in middle Tennessee, USA, experienced a first trimester pregnancy loss after \\nmultiple tick bites. Histopathology, 16S rRNA sequencing, and electron microscopy \\nexamination of the products of conception revealed an infection by a bacterium within \\ntheCandidatusMidichloria genus. Seoul virus (SEOV) is a worldwide ratborne \\northohantavirus. We describe an SEOV infection in an adult returning to France from Kenya, \\nfollowed by Guillain-Barré syndrome. We confirmed SEOV infection by PCR and sequencing. \\nAlthough transmission might have occurred in Kenya, the epidemiologic information \\navailable is not sufficient to confirm that possibility. We describe detection of SAT2 \\ntopotype XIV foot-and-mouth disease viruses in western Asia during 2022?2023. Sequences \\nshow the viruses originated in eastern Africa and were introduced into western Asia on >1 \\noccasion. The rapid spread in naive animals highlights risks for onward transmission and \\npotential endemicity in Asia. A 58-year-old woman in Belgium with a history of follicular \\nlymphoma treated with rituximab sought care for a rapid sensory-motor deficit. \\nSeronegative neuroborreliosis caused byBorrelia spielmaniiwas diagnosed, likely related to \\nhumoral deficiency. High CXC motif chemokine ligand 13 levels and PCR confirmed the \\ndiagnosis. Ceftriaxone treatment led to full recovery. Acute Q fever is classically described \\nas a mild illness. We report 9 patients with acute Q fever in Queensland, Australia, who \\nrequired intensive care unit support to survive. Clinicians should consider an acute Q fever \\ndiagnosis and its empirical treatment in critically ill persons in the appropriate clinical \\ncontext. Until 2023, North Macedonia had not reported a Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever \\n(CCHF) case for >50 years. In 2024, increased clinical vigilance identified and characterized \\n2 novel CCHF cases. Genetic analysis and the identification of possible reassortment indicate \\nNorth Macedonia as an interaction zone between CCHF virus isolates from Turkey and \\nKosovo. We conducted patient chart reviews and whole-genome sequencing of wound \\nspecimens containing presumptiveCorynebacterium ulceransfrom Vancouver, British \\nColumbia, Canada, during July 2019?July 2023. Sequencing confirmed 8/14 isolates wereC. \\nramoniiand identified 2 distinct clusters. Molecular methods should be used to clinically \\ndifferentiate potential toxin-producingCorynebacteriumspp. We compared virus replication \\nand host responses in human alveolar epithelium infected with highly pathogenic avian \\ninfluenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses. A/Vietnam/1203/2004 replicated most efficiently, \\nfollowed by A/Texas/37/2024, then A/bovine/Ohio/B24OSU-342/2024. Induction of '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 261, 'page_label': '344'}, page_content='interferon-stimulated genes was lower with A/Texas/37/2024 and \\nA/bovine/Ohio/B24OSU-342/2024, which may indicate a reduced disease severity of those \\nviruses. We describe chronic wasting disease (CWD) prion detection in raw and cooked \\nmeat from a CWD-positive elk. We found limited zoonotic potential in CWD prions from \\nthose meat products. Nonetheless, risk for transmission to humans is still unclear, and \\nmonitoring of circulating and emerging CWD prion strains for zoonotic potential is \\nwarranted. In 2021, we screened 91 children in Haiti with acute undifferentiated febrile \\nillness for arbovirus infections. We identified a major outbreak of dengue virus type 2, with \\n67% of the children testing positive. Two others were positive for chikungunya \\nEast/Central/South African IIa subclade, and 2 were positive for Zika virus. We report an \\ninvasive mycosis case in Japan caused byBjerkandera adusta, a fungal species not previously \\nreported as a causative pathogen of invasive mycosis.B. adustawas identified by using \\nphylogenetic analysis. Voriconazole was used successfully for treatment. Immunodeficient \\npatients may be susceptible to infection by rare causative fungi. We report infection with \\nthe phytopathogenPantoea stewartiisubspeciesindologenesin a macadamia farmer from \\nsoutheast Queensland, Australia. The patient had bloodstream infection and pneumonia \\ndevelop after an unidentified inoculation event. Investigation determined that the most \\nlikely mode of transmission was inhalation from an environmental source on the farm. Use \\nof 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Kenya has led to substantial reductions in \\nvaccine-type pneumococcal carriage and invasive pneumococcal disease. However, analysis \\nof recent surveillance data indicates an outbreak of vaccine-type serotype 1 in 2023 in \\nKibera, Kenya. Continued monitoring of invasive pneumococcal disease in Kenya is \\nwarranted. We isolated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) subtype IE \\nphylogenetically related to Gulf Coast strains in a spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) released \\nfrom a rescue center in Guatemala. Serologic testing of 118 monkeys indicated no additional \\nVEEV infections. Infection of a primate warrants intensified surveillance of VEEV \\ntransmission cycles in North America. We inoculated clinical materials into deer mice to \\nattempt isolation of Sin Nombre virus. We did not observe productive infection in the \\nnatural rodent reservoir. Genomic comparisons between rodent reservoirs and human \\ndisease may provide insight into hantavirus evolution and genetic determinants, but \\nreverse zoonosis of Sin Nombre virus appears unlikely. Only 2 cases of human adenovirus \\ntype 14 (HAdV-14) have been reported in Japan since 1980. We report a 7-year-old girl with \\nacute encephalopathy associated with HAdV-14 infection genetically similar to strains from \\nthe United States. The patient had not had contact with international travelers. HAdV-14 \\nsurveillance should be strengthened in Japan. We report a case of Zika virus (ZIKV) \\ninfection in a pregnant woman from Denmark who traveled to Thailand during her first \\ntrimester. Late in the second trimester, severe microcephaly was diagnosed in the fetus, and \\nZIKV infection was confirmed. Travelers and clinicians should be aware of ongoing ZIKV \\nrisk in Thailand. Melioidosis is caused by the environmental pathogenBurkholderia \\npseudomallei. Among 1,331 patients with melioidosis during 1989?2023 in the Darwin \\nProspective Melioidosis Study in Australia, we identified 6 locally acquired cases caused \\nbyB. pseudomalleisequence type 46. Because of global transmission and expansion of \\nendemicity, clinicians should increase awareness of melioidosis. In October 2023, a partially '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 262, 'page_label': '345'}, page_content='engorged femaleIxodestick was removed from a dog in Bozeman, Montana, USA, that had \\nrecently spent time in eastern Montana. The tick was identified asI. scapularisaccording to \\nmorphologic characteristics and genomic sequencing, suggesting an expanded geographic \\ndistribution requiring continued public health surveillance. RNA metagenomic analysis of \\ntissues from 4 wild-caught northern short-tailed shrews in Alabama, USA, revealed a novel \\nhenipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae). Phylogenetic analysis supported the placement of \\nthe virus within the shrew henipavirus clade, related to human-infecting shrewborne \\nhenipaviruses. Our study results highlight the presence of henipavirus infections in North \\nAmerica. In April 2024, Vietnam confirmed its first human case of influenza A(H9N2) in a \\n37-year-old man, marking a critical point in regional infectious disease monitoring and \\nresponse. This case underscores the importance of robust surveillance systems and One \\nHealth collaboration in managing emerging zoonotic threats. A panaritium developed in a \\nwoman in Demark after her cat scratched her. Analysis of tissue by 16S rRNA gene \\nsequencing revealedMycoplasma phocimorsus, known to cause seal finger. The source of \\nthe bacterium likely transmitted by the cat is unknown, but awareness of potential zoonotic \\ntransmission from cats should be raised. Arboviruses represent a major cause of illness in \\nAfrica and have the potential to trigger widespread epidemics. We present data on \\narbovirus epidemics in Africa in 2023 and demonstrate the need for global public health \\nauthorities to intensify efforts in the surveillance and control of arbovirus diseases. Data \\nwere collected from the World Health Organization Weekly Bulletin on Outbreaks and Other \\nEmergencies, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Weekly Event Based \\nSurveillance Report, and other online sources. In 2023, a total of 7 arboviruses were \\nresponsible for 29 outbreaks across 25 countries in Africa, 22 of which occurred in West \\nAfrica; the outbreaks resulted in 19,569 confirmed cases and 820 deaths. Arbovirus \\nepidemics in Africa pose a threat not only to public health within the continent but also \\nglobally, underscoring the urgent need for substantial investment in arbovirus surveillance, \\nresearch, and preparedness capacities in Africa to prevent and respond to health crises \\neffectively. The current recommendation for treating Lassa fever with ribavirin is supported \\nonly by weak evidence. Given the persistent effects in areas with endemic transmission and \\nepidemic potential, there is an urgent need to reassess ribavirin and investigate other \\npotential therapeutic candidates; however, a robust clinical trial method adapted to Lassa \\nfever epidemiology has not yet been established. We propose an adaptive phase II/III \\nmulticenter randomized controlled platform trial that uses a superiority framework with an \\nequal allocation ratio and accounts for challenges selecting the primary end point and \\nestimating the target sample size by using an interim analysis. Top Given recent outbreaks \\nof Oropouche virus in Latin America and >100 confirmed travel-associated cases in the \\nUnited States, we evaluated the competence of US vectors, includingAedes albopictus,Culex \\nquinquefasciatus,Culex pipiens, andAnopheles quadrimaculatusmosquitoes. Results with \\nhistoric and recent isolates suggest transmission potential for those species is low. Top The \\nrequested issue is not available.

Rickettsia sibirica mongolitimonaeis an \\nemerging cause of tickborne rickettsiosis. Since the bacterium was first documented as a \\nhuman pathogen in 1996, a total of 69 patients with this infection have been reported in the \\nliterature. Because of the rising rate ofR. sibirica mongolitimonaeinfection cases, we \\nevaluated the epidemiologic and clinical features of 29 patients who hadR. sibirica \\nmongolitimonaeinfections confirmed during 2007?2024 at the Center for Rickettsiosis and \\nArthropod-Borne Diseases, the reference laboratory of San Pedro University \\nHospital?Center for Biomedical Research of La Rioja, Logroño, Spain. We also reviewed all \\ncases published in the literature during 1996?2024, evaluating features of 94 cases ofR. \\nsibirica mongolitimonaeinfection (89 in Europe, 4 in Africa, and 1 in Asia). Clinicians should \\nconsiderR. sibirica mongolitimonaeas a potential causative agent of rickettsiosis, and \\ndoxycycline should be administered promptly to avoid clinical complications. Streptococcus \\npneumoniaeinfection is considered an uncommon cause of arthritis in adults. To determine \\nthe clinical and microbiological characteristics of pneumococcal septic arthritis, we \\nretrospectively studied a large series of cases among adult patients during the 2010?2018 \\nconjugate vaccine era in France. We identified 110 patients (56 women, 54 men; mean age \\n65 years), and cases included 82 native joint infections and 28 prosthetic joint infections. \\nMost commonly affected were the knee (50/110) and hip (25/110). Concomitant \\npneumococcal infections were found in 37.2% (38/102) and bacteremia in 57.3% (55/96) \\nof patients, and underlying conditions were noted for 81.4% (83/102). Mortality rate was \\n9.4% (8/85). The proportion of strains not susceptible to penicillin was 29.1% (32/110). Of \\nthe 55 serotyped strains, 31 (56.4%) were covered by standard pneumococcal vaccines; \\nhowever, several nonvaccine serotypes (mainly 23B, 24F, and 15A) had emerged, for which \\nsusceptibility to ?-lactams was low. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2013?2016 \\nwas large, leaving in its wake an estimated 17,000 survivors in West Africa. Uveitis is one of \\nthe most common ophthalmic manifestations of EVD, but long-term follow-up in the at-risk \\npopulation is lacking. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of 521 EVD \\nsurvivors from Sierra Leone who underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination a \\nmedian of 1,289 days, or ?3.5 years, after discharge from Ebola treatment units. The most \\ncommon ophthalmic findings were cataracts (117 eyes, 11.2%), uveitis (86 eyes, 8.3%), dry \\neyes (81 eyes, 7.8%), and chorioretinal scar (68 eyes, 6.5%). EVD survivors with cataracts, \\nuveitis, optic neuropathy, and corneal scar were more likely to have vision impairment, \\ndefined as Snellen visual acuity worse than 20/50. Results of our study highlight the need \\nfor ongoing vision care in EVD survivors. Congregate homeless shelters are \\ndisproportionately affected by infectious disease outbreaks. We describe enterovirus \\nepidemiology across 23 adult and family shelters in King County, Washington, USA, during \\nOctober 2019?May 2021, by using repeated cross-sectional respiratory illness and \\nenvironmental surveillance and viral genome sequencing. Among 3,281 participants>3 \\nmonths of age, we identified coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21) in 39 adult residents (3.0% [95% \\nCI 1.9%?4.8%] detection) across 7 shelters during October 2019?February 2020. We '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 264, 'page_label': '347'}, page_content='identified enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in 5 adult residents in 2 shelters during \\nOctober?November 2019. Of 812 environmental samples, 1 was EV-D68?positive and 5 \\nwere CVA21?positive. Other enteroviruses detected among residents, but not in \\nenvironmental samples, included coxsackievirus A6/A4 in 3 children. No enteroviruses \\nwere detected during April 2020?May 2021. Phylogenetically clustered CVA21 and EV-D68 \\ncases occurred in some shelters. Some shelters also hosted multiple CVA21 lineages. \\nMycobacterium abscessusinfection is challenging to treat. \\nExtrapulmonaryM.abscessusinfections (EP-MAB) are less common than \\npulmonaryM.abscessusinfections. To evaluate treatment regimens, we retrospectively \\nanalyzed consecutive microbiologically confirmed EP-MAB cases diagnosed in France \\nduring 2012?2020. We studied 45 patients with EP-MAB, including 14 bone and joint \\ninfections, 10 skin and soft tissue infections, and 8 lymph node infections. Most (62%) \\npatients had no reported immunodeficiency. In 27 patients, EP-MAB followed healthcare-\\nassociated (44%) or environmental (16%) injuries. Of the 45 isolates, 25 were \\nsubspeciesabscessus, 10bolletii, and 9massiliense; 1 was unidentified. Cure was achieved \\nfor 36 (80%) patients who received a median antimicrobial regimen of 6 months; 22 (55%) \\nalso underwent surgery. Four patients died, and 5 were unavailable for follow-up. EP-MAB \\npredominantly affects immunocompetent patients after an injury; outcomes are favorable. \\nWe propose a >6-month regimen of antimicrobial therapy with consideration for surgery \\nand regular patient reassessment. Pasteurellaspp. can cause fatal zoonotic infections in \\nhumans. We performed a multicenter study to investigate the prevalence and clinical \\nfeatures ofPasteurellainfections in South Korea during 2018?2022. We also conducted a \\ncollaborative systematic review and meta-analysis of the global burden \\nofPasteurellabacteremia. The study included 283 cases found an increasing trend \\ninPasteurellainfections. Blood cultures were positive in 8/35 (22.9%) cases sampled, for \\noverall bacteremia-associated rate of 2.8% (8/283). Aging was a significant risk factor for \\nbacteremia (odds ratio 1.05 [95% CI 1.01?1.10]), according to multivariate analyses. For the \\nmeta-analysis, we included a total of 2,012 cases from 10 studies. The pooled prevalence of \\nbacteremia was 12.4% (95% CI 7.3%?18.6%) and of mortality 8.4% (95% CI 2.7%?16.5%). \\nOur findings reflect the need for greater understanding of the increase \\ninPasteurellainfections and the global burden ofPasteurellabacteremia to determine \\nappropriate case management. We investigated differences in risk factors and preventive \\nbehaviors by age and sex among persons with reported Lyme disease in Ontario, Canada, \\nduring 2015?2022. Incidence rates peaked among children 5?9 and adults 50?79 years of \\nage. Median age was higher for female than male case-patients (54 vs. 51 years). Male case-\\npatients reported more activity in wooded and tall grass areas than did female case-\\npatients; fewer male case-patients reported sharing living space with outdoor-exposed \\ncompanion animals. As age increased, more case-patients reported activity in blacklegged \\ntick habitats, exposure to ticks, and wearing adequate clothing, but fewer reported sharing \\nliving space with outdoor-exposed companion animals. Adoption of preventive behaviors \\nwas relatively low and did not differ by sex. Male case-patients, children 5?9 years of age \\nand their parents or caregivers, and adults >59 years of age represent populations that \\nwould benefit from tailored public health messaging on Lyme disease prevention. We '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 265, 'page_label': '348'}, page_content='conducted a prospective study of 159 cases ofStreptococcus \\ndysgalactiaesubspeciesequisimilis(SDSE) bacteremia in 157 patients at 2 hospitals in \\nFinland during November 2015?November 2019. Cellulitis was associated with nonsevere \\ndisease (p = 0.008); necrotizing fasciitis was associated with severe disease (p = 0.004). \\nFifty percent of patients had>1 clinical characteristic associated with risk for death. The \\ncase-fatality rate was 6%, and 7% of patients were treated in an intensive care unit. Blood \\nleukocyte counts on days 2 (p = 0.032) and 3 (p = 0.020) and C-reactive protein levels on \\ndays 3 (p = 0.030) and 4 (p = 0.009) after admission were predictors of severe disease. The \\nPitt bacteremia score was an accurate predictor of death. Using the Pitt bacteremia score, \\nleukocyte counts, and CRP responses during initial treatment can improve treatment \\nstrategies and survival for patients with SDSE. Evidence on mortality rates and causes of \\ndeath associated with extrapulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection is \\nlimited. This nationwide register-based study in Denmark used diagnostic codes to match \\nadult patients with extrapulmonary NTM infection 1:4 to controls. During 2000?2017, we \\nidentified 485 patients, who had significantly more comorbidities than controls. The 5-year \\nmortality rate for patients was 26.8% (95% CI 23.1%?31.0%) and for controls, 10.9% (95% \\nCI 9.6%?12.4%). The median age at death was 76 (interquartile range 63?85) years for \\npatients and 84 (interquartile range 73?90) years for controls. The adjusted hazard rate of \\ndeath for patients was 1.34 (95% CI 1.10?1.63; p = 0.004). Patients and controls mainly died \\nof cardiovascular disease and solid malignant neoplasms. Hematologic malignancies and \\nHIV were more frequently causes of death in patients. Mortality rates are substantial among \\npatients with extrapulmonary NTM infection, predominantly caused by underlying \\nconditions. Human infections withCorynebacteriumdiphtheriaespecies complex (CdSC) \\nbacteria were rare in French Guiana until 2016, when the number of cases diagnosed \\nincreased. We conducted an epidemiologic, multicenter, retrospective study of all human \\nCdSC infections diagnosed in French Guiana during January 1, 2016?December 31, 2021. A \\ntotal of 64 infectious episodes were observed in 60 patients; 61 infections were caused byC. \\ndiphtheriaeand 3 byC.ulcerans.

Archaea represent a separate domain of life, next to \\nbacteria and eukarya. As components of the human microbiome, archaea have been \\nassociated with various diseases, including periodontitis, endodontic infections, small \\nintestinal bacterial overgrowth, and urogenital tract infections. Archaea are generally \\nconsidered nonpathogenic; the reasons are speculative because of limited knowledge and \\ngene annotation challenges. Nevertheless, archaeal syntrophic principles that shape global \\nmicrobial networks aid both archaea and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Evaluating \\narchaea interactions remains challenging, requiring clinical studies on inflammatory \\npotential and the effects of archaeal metabolism. Establishing a culture collection is crucial \\nfor investigating archaea functions within the human microbiome, which could improve '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 266, 'page_label': '349'}, page_content='health outcomes in infectious diseases. We summarize potential reasons for archaeal \\nnonpathogenicity, assess the association with infectious diseases in humans, and discuss the \\nnecessary experimental steps to enable mechanistic studies involving archaea. \\nXenotransplantation, transplantation into humans of vascularized organs or viable cells \\nfrom nonhuman species, is a potential solution to shortages of transplantable human \\norgans. Among challenges to application of clinical xenotransplantation are unknown risks \\nof transmission of animal microbes to immunosuppressed recipients or the community. \\nExperience in allotransplantation and in preclinical models suggests that viral infections are \\nthe greatest concern. Worldwide, the distribution of swine pathogens is heterogeneous and \\ncannot be fully controlled by international agricultural regulations. It is possible to screen \\nsource animals for potential human pathogens before procuring organs in a manner not \\npossible within the time available for surveillance testing in allotransplantation. Infection \\ncontrol measures require microbiological assays for surveillance of source animals and \\nxenograft recipients and research into zoonotic potential of porcine organisms. Available \\ndata suggest that infectious risks of xenotransplantation are manageable and that clinical \\ntrials can advance with appropriate protocols for microbiological monitoring of source \\nanimals and recipients. We conducted surveillance for carbapenem-resistant \\nEnterobacterales (CRE) during 2016?2020 at 10 US sites and extended-spectrum ?-\\nlactamase?producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) during 2019?2020 at 6 US sites. Among \\n159 CRE cases in children (median age 5 years), CRE was isolated from urine for 131 \\n(82.4%) and blood from 20 (12.6%). Annual CRE incidence rate (cases/100,000 population) \\nwas 0.47?0.87. Among 207 ESBL-E cases in children (median age 6 years), ESBL-E was \\nisolated from urine of 196 (94.7%) and blood of 8 (3.9%). Annual ESBL-E incidence rate \\nwas 26.5 in 2019 and 19.63 in 2020. CRE and ESBL-E rates were >2-fold higher among \\ninfants than other age groups. Most CRE and ESBL-E cases were healthcare-associated \\ncommunity-onset (68 [43.0%] for CRE vs. 40 [23.7%] for ESBL-E) or community-associated \\n(43 [27.2%] for CRE vs. 109 [64.5%] for ESBL-E). Programs to detect, prevent, and treat \\nmultidrug-resistant infections must include pediatric populations (particularly the \\nyoungest) and outpatient settings. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tickborne \\ninfection that can range from asymptomatic to fatal and has been described in >30 \\ncountries. Early identification and isolation of patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF \\nand the use of appropriate prevention and control measures are essential for preventing \\nhuman-to-human transmission. Here, we provide an overview of the epidemiology, clinical \\nfeatures, and prevention and control of CCHF. CCHF poses a continued public health threat \\ngiven its wide geographic distribution, potential to spread to new regions, propensity for \\ngenetic variability, and potential for severe and fatal illness, in addition to the limited \\nmedical countermeasures for prophylaxis and treatment.

During October 2021?June 2023, a total of 392 cases of acute \\nhepatitis of unknown etiology in children in the United States were reported to Centers for \\nDisease Control and Prevention as part of national surveillance. We describe demographic \\nand clinical characteristics, including potential involvement of adenovirus in development \\nof acute hepatitis, of 8 fatally ill children who met reporting criteria. The children had \\ndiverse courses of illness. Two children were immunocompromised when initially brought \\nfor care. Four children tested positive for adenovirus in multiple specimen types, including \\n2 for whom typing was completed. One adenovirus-positive child had no known underlying \\nconditions, supporting a potential relationship between adenovirus and acute hepatitis in \\npreviously healthy children. Our findings emphasize the importance of continued \\ninvestigation to determine the mechanism of liver injury and appropriate treatment. \\nTesting for adenovirus in similar cases could elucidate the role of the virus. In 2022, \\nconcurrent outbreaks of hepatitis A, invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), and mpox were \\nidentified in Florida, USA, primarily among men who have sex with men. The hepatitis A \\noutbreak (153 cases) was associated with hepatitis A virus genotype IA. The IMD outbreak \\n(44 cases) was associated withNeisseria meningitidisserogroup C, sequence type 11, clonal \\ncomplex 11. The mpox outbreak in Florida (2,845 cases) was part of a global epidemic. The \\nhepatitis A and IMD outbreaks were concentrated in Central Florida and peaked during \\nMarch?\\xadJune, whereas mpox cases were more heavily concentrated in South Florida and had \\npeak incidence in August. HIV infection was more common (52%) among mpox cases than \\namong hepatitis A (21%) or IMD (34%) cases. Where feasible, vaccination against hepatitis \\nA, meningococcal disease, and mpox should be encouraged among at-risk groups and \\noffered along with program services that target those groups. Disseminated leishmaniasis \\n(DL) is an emergent severe disease manifesting with multiple lesions. To determine the \\nrelationship between immune response and clinical and therapeutic outcomes, we studied \\n101 DL and 101 cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases and determined cytokines and \\nchemokines in supernatants of mononuclear cells stimulated with leishmania antigen. \\nPatients were treated with meglumine antimoniate (20 mg/kg) for 20 days (CL) or 30 days \\n(DL); 19 DL patients were instead treated with amphotericin B, miltefosine, or miltefosine \\nand meglumine antimoniate.

Streptococcus suis, a zoonotic bacterial pathogen circulated through \\nswine, can cause severe infections in humans. Because humanS. suisinfections are not \\nnotifiable in most countries, incidence is underestimated. We aimed to increase insight into \\nthe molecular epidemiology of humanS. suisinfections in Europe. To procure data, we \\nsurveyed 7 reference laboratories and performed a systematic review of the scientific \\nliterature. We identified 236 cases of humanS. suisinfection from those sources and an \\nadditional 87 by scanning gray literature. We performed whole-genome sequencing to type \\n46 zoonoticS. suisisolates and combined them with 28 publicly available genomes in a core-\\ngenome phylogeny. Clonal complex (CC) 1 isolates accounted for 87% of typed human \\ninfections; CC20, CC25, CC87, and CC94 also caused infections. Emergence of diverse \\nzoonotic clades and notable severity of illness in humans support classifyingS. suisinfection \\nas a notifiable condition. During January?August 2021, the Community Prevalence of SARS-\\nCoV-2 Study used time/location sampling to recruit a cross-sectional, population-based \\ncohort to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and nasal swab sample PCR positivity across \\n15 US communities. Survey-weighted estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine \\nwillingness among participants at each site were compared within demographic groups by \\nusing linear regression models with inverse variance weighting. Among 22,284 persons>2 \\nmonths of age and older, median prevalence of infection (prior, active, or both) was 12.9% \\nacross sites and similar across age groups. Within each site, average prevalence of infection \\nwas 3 percentage points higher for Black than White persons and average vaccine \\nwillingness was 10 percentage points lower for Black than White persons and 7 percentage \\npoints lower for Black persons than for persons in other racial groups. The higher \\nprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among groups with lower vaccine willingness highlights \\nthe disparate effect of COVID-19 and its complications. Invasive fusariosis can be life-\\nthreatening, especially in immunocompromised patients who require intensive care unit \\n(ICU) admission. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study to describe clinical and \\nbiologic characteristics, patient outcomes, and factors associated with death and response \\nto antifungal therapy. We identified 55 patients with invasive fusariosis from 16 ICUs in \\nFrance during 2002\\xad?\\xad\\xad2020. The mortality rate was high (56%). Fusariosis-related \\npneumonia occurred in 76% of patients, often leading to acute respiratory failure. Factors \\nassociated with death included elevated sequential organ failure assessment score at ICU \\nadmission or history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or hematologic \\nmalignancies. Neither voriconazole treatment nor disseminated fusariosis were strongly \\nassociated with response to therapy.

While an infected person sleeps, female \\npinworms leave the intestine through the anus and deposit their eggs on the surrounding \\nskin. Two to three hours after pinworms lay their eggs, the eggs become capable of infecting \\nother people who accidentally swallow them. The eggs can easily infect another person, \\nespecially caretakers or close contacts of infected children or adults: Washing your hands \\nwith soap and warm water is the best way to prevent pinworm infection.

Non-polio enteroviruses, like EV-D68, are common, with most \\ninfections causing no symptoms or only mild symptoms. You are more likely to get infected \\nwith enteroviruses during summer and fall, but infections can happen year-round. EV-D68 \\ncan cause mild to severe respiratory illness or no symptoms at all. EV-D68 can also cause \\nAFM, an uncommon but dangerous neurological condition that mostly affects children. AFM \\ncauses the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak. Symptoms include: In general, \\ninfants, children, and teenagers are most likely to get infected with enteroviruses and \\nbecome ill. This is because they do not yet have immunity (protection) from previous \\nexposure to these viruses. CDC believes this is also true for EV-D68. Adults can get infected \\nwith enteroviruses, but they are more likely to have no symptoms or mild symptoms. \\nChildren with asthma may have a higher risk for severe symptoms from EV-D68 and other \\nrespiratory illnesses. Families should follow CDC guidance to maintain control of symptoms \\nduring enterovirus season. The season occurs each year in the United States during summer \\nand fall. Since EV-D68 causes respiratory illness, the virus can be found in an infected \\nperson?s respiratory secretions, such as: EV-D68 likely spreads from person to person \\nwhen an infected person: There are no vaccines to prevent EV-D68 infections. You can take \\nother actions to help protect yourself and others from health risks caused by respiratory \\nviruses, including EV-D68. CDC'sRespiratory Virus Guidanceprovides practical \\nrecommendations and information to help you lower your risk. To prevent severe illness \\nfrom EV-D68, children and adults with asthma should also follow CDC's information on how \\nto manage their asthma. Most healthcare providers are not able to test for EV-D68. EV-D68 \\ncan only be diagnosed by doing specific lab tests on specimens from a person's nose and \\nthroat or blood. Many hospitals and some doctors can test ill patients to see if they have \\nenterovirus infection. However, most hospitals and doctors cannot do specific testing to \\ndetermine the type of enterovirus, like EV-D68. CDC and some state health departments test \\nfor different enterovirus types by doing specialized tests including PCR or molecular \\nsequencing. CDC recommends the following: There is no specific treatment or antiviral \\navailable for people with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Talk to a doctor about your \\nsymptoms and how to best control them. Some people with a dangerous respiratory illness \\nmay need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy.

In 2017, there were \\nan estimated 197,400 cases of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales among hospitalized \\npatients and 9,100 estimated deaths in the United States. ESBL-producing Enterobacterales \\ncan cause several different infections, including urinary tract and bloodstream infections. \\nThese bacteria can also live in a patient without causing infection or symptoms, known as \\ncolonization. ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections occur in healthcare settings like \\nhospitals and nursing homes. These infections may also occur in healthy people.

Eye infections caused by fungi are extremely rare but \\ncan be very serious. There are two main types of fungal eye infections, depending on the \\npart of the eye that is infected. Many types of fungi can cause eye infections. The two types \\nof fungal eye infections arekeratitisandendophthalmitis. Keratitis is an infection of the clear, \\nfront layer of the eye (the cornea). \\nEndophthalmitis is an infection of the inside of the eye (the vitreous and/or aqueous \\nhumor). Endophthalmitis can occur two different ways.Exogenousfungal endophthalmitis \\noccurs after fungal spores enter the eye from an external source.Endogenousfungal \\nendophthalmitis occurs when a bloodstream infection (for example,candidemia) spreads to \\none or both eyes. The symptoms of a fungal eye infection can show up anytime from several \\ndays to several weeks after an?exposure. Fungal eye infection symptoms are similar to \\nthose of other types of eye infections, like those caused by bacteria. Symptoms can include: \\nA fungal eye infection can be caused by: People who have diabetes, aweakened immune \\nsystem, or use corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory steroids) have a higher risk of fungal eye \\ninfections. Fungal keratitis may be more common among people living in rural areas. \\nWearing eye protection when outside can help prevent fungal eye infections caused by eye \\ninjuries that involve plant material. For many activities, wearing sunglasses can offer some \\nprotection. Outdoor workers and farmworkers should wear appropriate?protective \\neyewear. People who wear contact lenses should care for their lenses properly. Learn more \\nabout how toprotect your eyeswhile wearing contacts. If you think you have an eye \\ninfection it is important to see a healthcare provider or eye doctor right away. An eye doctor \\ncan examine your eye and test for infection. The most common way to diagnose a fungal eye \\ninfection is done by a doctor collecting a sample of tissue or fluid from the eye.  The sample \\nis sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope or cultured. Polymerase chain \\nreaction and confocal microscopy, a type of optical imaging, are also being used as newer, \\nfaster forms of diagnosis. The treatment for a fungal eye infection depends on the type of \\nfungus, the severity of the infection, and the parts of the eye that are affected. Possible \\nforms of treatment for fungal eye infections include: Eye surgery may be needed if \\ninfections do not get better after using antifungal medications.

One of the main signs of FH is LDL cholesterol levels over 190 mg/dL \\nin adults (and over 160 mg/dL in children). In addition, most people with FH have afamily \\nhealth historyof early coronary artery disease or heart attacks. In some cases, elevated LDL \\nlevels are found through routine blood cholesterol screening. If you have a family health \\nhistory of heart disease or FH and have not had your cholesterol screened, your healthcare \\nprovider may order lipid screening, which measures the amount of cholesterol and lipids \\n(fats) in your blood. Your healthcare provider may be able to detect physical signs of FH \\nduring a clinical exam, although not everyone with FH has these signs. These physical signs \\nof FH occur when extra cholesterol builds up in different parts of the body: If your \\nhealthcare provider suspects you have FH, he or she may refer you forgenetic \\ncounselingandtesting for FH. FH is mainly caused by inherited genetic changes (mutations) \\nin theLDLR,APOB, andPCSK9genes, which affect how your body regulates and removes \\ncholesterol from your blood. About 60-80% of people with FH have a genetic change found \\nin one of these genes.Genetic testingis available to check for these and other rarer genetic \\nchanges. However, there are likely more genes involved in FH that remain unknown. You \\nhave two copies of each of the genes involved in FH, one from your mother and one from \\nyour father. A genetic change in only one copy of theLDLR,APOB, orPCSK9genes is enough \\nto cause FH. If either your mother or father has a genetic change in one of these genes that \\ncauses FH, they have a 50% chance of passing it on to you. Most people with FH only have \\none FH-causing genetic change. In very rare cases, a person can have two FH-causing \\nchanges in both copies of the same gene, which results in a much more serious, rare form of \\nFH called homozygous FH. There are two forms of homozygous FH: People with \\nhomozygous FH have extremely high levels of cholesterol and can have heart attacks in \\nchildhood. People with homozygous FH need to find a healthcare provider knowledgeable \\nabout FH andstart treatmentright away. If you are concerned that you could have familial \\nhypercholesterolemia or hereditary heart disease, the first step is to collect yourfamily \\nhealth history of heart diseaseand share this information with your healthcare provider. \\nLearn how having a family health history of heart disease could impact your health and \\nsteps to take.

Parvovirus B19 infection usually causes no symptoms or mild \\nillness, such as flu-like symptoms, rashes and joint pains. In individuals with blood \\ndisorders or a weakened immune system, infection can cause a low blood count. Infection \\nduring pregnancy can sometimes lead to additional complications. Some people who get \\ninfected with this virus will have no symptoms. When symptoms of parvovirus B19 \\ninfection occur, they are usually mild and may include the following: The clinical \\npresentation most often associated with parvovirus B19 infection is a red rash on the face, \\nalso called a \"slapped cheek\" rash. This is also known as Fifth Disease (or Erythema \\nInfectiosum). This rash typically appears a few days after the fever or flu-like symptoms. It \\nis more common in children than adults. Parvovirus B19 infection can also cause a general \\nrash on the chest, back, buttocks, or arms and legs. The rash may be itchy. It usually goes \\naway in 7 to 10 days but can come and go for several weeks. As it starts to go away, it may \\nlook lacy. Infection with parvovirus B19 can lead to pain and swelling in the joints, called \\npolyarthopathy syndrome. This is more common in adults than children and is most \\ncommon in women. Adults may experience joint pain without other symptoms. Joints are \\naffected on both sides, usually in the hands, feet and knees. The joint pain usually lasts 1 to \\n3 weeks but can last for months or longer. It usually goes away without any long-term \\nproblems. Parvovirus B19 infection is usually mild for children and adults who are \\notherwise healthy. However, for some people, it can cause serious health complications \\naffecting the nerves, joints, or blood system. Parvovirus B19 has been shown to cause a \\nsevere drop in blood count (anemia) in some patients with certainblood disordersor with a '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 306, 'page_label': '389'}, page_content=\"weakened immune system.

Fish \\ncan make great pets for people with allergies to other pets and they've been shown help to \\nhelp reduce stress. Although fish can make entertaining and calming pets, fish owners \\nshould be aware that fish sometimes carry germs that can make people sick. Although rare, \\ngerms from fish and the water they live in can cause a variety of illnesses in people. Below \\nare certain diseases that can be spread by pet fish. Before buying a pet fish, make sure a fish \\nis the right type of pet for your family. Be aware that pet fish can sometimes spread germs \\nto people. Children younger than 5 years old, adults 65 or older, and people with weakened \\nimmune systems aremore likely to get severe illnessfrom germs fish can carry. You don't \\nhave to touch a fish to get sick from the germs it can carry. Fish tanks, equipment, and tank \\nwater can be contaminated with germs. The best way to prevent illness from fish and their \\nenvironment is to wash your hands often. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if \\nsoap and water are not readily available. \\n Supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing \\nalcohol. Tank water and items in your fish tank can be contaminated with germs. Some \\nlarger fish have sharp points in their fins that could scratch or damage your skin. Although \\nit doesn't happen often, germs can spread from fin scratches or scrapes from the gravel or \\nrocks in a tank, even when the wound does not seem deep or serious. If you get a scratch or \\ncut while caring for pet fish: Before bringing home a pet fish, research what types of fish and \\naquariums are suitable for your family. Know that some fish can require more extensive \\ncare than others, and some fish can live a very long time. Certain types of fish require more \\nextensive care and supplies than others. Learn about the different types of aquariums and \\ntheir maintenance needs. Work with pet store staff to decide if a fresh or saltwater tank is \\nright for you. Saltwater tanks need more maintenance than freshwater tanks. \\nMatch the size of the tank to the space available in your home and to the amount of time you \\nhave to maintain it. Consider purchasing a second aquarium to be used when you're \\ncleaning your first tank, or to house new fish before you place them in your established \\ntank. Having a second tank to temporarily house fish may help reduce their stress and \\ndisease. \\nOnce you've decided what type of aquarium you want, learn how to set it up properly.

Before bringing \\nfish home, make sure your aquarium is ready. Ask your veterinarian about \"cycling a tank\" \\nto get the bacteria and nitrogen levels balanced. \\nLearn which fish can go in the aquarium you have. Most fish live in either saltwater or \\nfreshwater, not both. Consider the number of fish to keep in your tank; a good standard is 1 \\ninch of fish per gallon of water. \\nDon\\'t forget to research which species of fish can be in the same tank together and what \\ntypes of food they will need. Some types of fish, like male betta fish, can\\'t be in the same \\naquarium together because they will fight. Pick fish that are active in their tanks in the pet \\nstore. Compare the fish to those of the same type around it. Is it acting like the others or is it \\noff by itself? Is it able to swim normally? Don\\'t select fish from a tank that has a high \\nnumber of dead fish. \\nHealthy fish should have smooth, sleek, shiny scales that aren\\'t discolored. Their bodies \\nshould not have any bumps, and their fins should be intact. When bringing a new fish home, \\nit\\'s very important to acclimate it to your aquarium water. Purchased fish will often be \\ngiven to you in a clear bag with water from their tank at the store. This water will be a \\ndifferent temperature than your aquarium water at home. To acclimate your fish: Check \\nyour fish daily for signs of illness. A sick fish may swim abnormally, have red, brown, or \\nwhite splotches, not eat, or be swollen. \\nIf a fish in your tank looks sick, it\\'s best to remove it and place it in a tank by itself. This will \\nhelp prevent other fish in your main aquarium from getting sick. Talk to a veterinarian \\nexperienced in fish medicine if you have questions about your pet\\'s health. Promptly \\nremove any dead fish from your aquarium so disease doesn\\'t spread to other fish. Even \\nthough fish appear healthy, they may still spread germs to humans.

Of all PWH in the United States from 2018?19,81% \\nwere prescribed ART, leaving nearly 20% potentially at increased risk for flu complications. \\nStudies have indicated that flu symptoms might be prolonged and the risk offlu-related \\ncomplicationsandprolonged influenza virus sheddingis higher for certain people living with \\nHIV. Because they are at higher risk of serious flu-related complications, it is especially \\nimportant that PWH get a flu shot annually. PWH who are not receiving ART might not have \\nas strong an immune response to vaccination as those who are receiving ART. PWH who get \\nflu symptoms, especially those with low CD4 cell counts not receiving ART, should be \\ntreated with influenza antiviral drugs right away. If you have HIV, you are at higher risk of \\ndeveloping serious flu-related complications, in addition to taking ART, the best way to \\nprevent flu is by getting a flu shot. Note: While PWH may still mount an immune response to \\nflu vaccination, people with advanced HIV disease may not respond as well. Doctors may \\nconsider using influenza antiviral drugs for prevention in some cases. In addition to getting \\na flu shot every year, people living with HIV should take the sameeveryday preventive \\nactionsCDC recommends of everyone, including avoiding people who are sick, covering \\ncoughs, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and \\ncleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with viruses. If you \\nhave HIV and get sick with flu symptoms, call your doctor right away.  CDC recommends \\nprompt flu antiviral treatment for people with HIV who have flu or suspected flu.

Food irradiation is safe, and its safety \\nand efficacy have been endorsed by federal agencies and intergovernmental organizations. \\nFood irradiation works by exposing food toionizingelectromagnetic (gamma or x-ray) \\nradiation. Food irradiation is considered a \"cold\" method, meaning it does not use heat to \\nkill germs. Other food safety processes that you may be more familiar with, like \\npasteurization and canning, use heat. The irradiation process happens after a food is \\nproduced and packaged. Food enters a chamber where it is exposed to a specific amount of \\nradiation. The radiation penetrates the food and kills germs or prevents them from '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 319, 'page_label': '402'}, page_content='multiplying, and it does not linger in the food. Irradiation is one more protective step, but it \\ndoes not replace other food safety measures. Irradiation can make foods safer that are \\ntypically eaten raw, like some produce. Irradiation can also make raw foods that you cook at \\nhome, like ground beef, safer to handle. That\\'s because irradiation kills most of the germs in \\nthe food before you buy it. Think of food irradiation as an added layer of protection against \\nharmful germs that can make you sick. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has \\napproved food irradiation as a safe and effective process. Food irradiation has been \\nevaluated for safety for over 30 years.  \\nMany agencies and organizations have endorsed its safety and effectiveness including: Even \\nastronauts eat irradiated food! All irradiated foods must display the Radura symbol to let \\nconsumers know that the product has been treated with irradiation. Labels may also say \\n\"Treated with Radiation\" or \"Treated by Irradiation.\" For more detailed information on \\nlabeling, please visit theFDA irradiation page. FDA has approved a variety of foods for \\nirradiation. Approved foods include: You can ask the stores where you shop if they sell \\nirradiated foods. Irradiated foods do not lose a significant amount of nutrients during the \\nprocess. Nutrient loss during irradiation is similar to the amount of nutrients lost during \\ncooking, freezing, canning, and other food safety methods. Irradiated foods do not become \\nradioactive, meaning they do not give off radiation. Eating irradiated foods does not expose \\nyou to or contaminate you with radiation or radioactive materials. During the food \\nirradiation process, beams of radiation pass through the food in the same way that X-ray \\nbeams pass through you when you get a medical X-ray. After you receive an X-ray, you are \\nnot radioactive, and no additional radiation or radioactive materials remain inside or \\noutside your body. Similarly, after food is irradiated it does not have any additional \\nradiation or radioactive materials inside or outside the food.

It is a CDC program to enhance the ability of state and \\nlocal health departments to respond to enteric disease outbreaks. FoodCORE centers work \\ntogether to develop improve methods to detect, investigate, respond to, and control \\nmultistate outbreaks of foodborne diseases. Efforts are primarily focused on outbreaks \\ncaused by bacteria, includingSalmonella, Shiga toxin-producingE. coli, andListeria. The \\nability to detect and investigate viral and parasitic foodborne disease outbreaks will also be \\nstrengthened. Each year in the United States foodborne diseases cause:1 Fast and effective \\noutbreak investigations are needed to identify and remove contaminated food from the \\nmarket to prevent additional illnesses. Identifying contaminated foods and learning how the \\ncontamination happened also help public health officials prevent similar outbreaks in the \\nfuture. However, most health departments lack the resources to conduct comprehensive \\nenteric disease surveillance and rapid, coordinated outbreak detection and response. \\nFoodCORE aims to improve enteric disease surveillance and outbreak response by \\nproviding targeted funding to strengthen capacity and collaboration. Program priorities \\ninclude: FoodCORE centers work to increase collaboration across laboratory, epidemiology, \\nand environmental health within their health department. Staff from each area play a \\ncritical role in ongoing enteric surveillance and outbreak response. This includes: With \\nincreased coordination between these three areas, the centers are able to: Performance \\nmetrics were developed and tested by FoodCORE centers to measure the burden, \\ntimeliness, and completeness of foodborne disease activities. Metrics span from outbreak \\nsurveillance and detection through investigation, response, control, and prevention \\nmeasures. FoodCORE centers report data forSalmonella, Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia \\ncoli(STEC), andListeria(SSL); andnorovirus, other enteric disease pathogens, and outbreaks \\nof unknown etiology (NOU). Metrics data are shared online to show the impact of the \\nchanges that FoodCORE centers have implemented in their health departments. FoodCORE \\ncenters are at the forefront of enteric disease surveillance and outbreak response. They will \\ncontinue to innovate and share their experiences with others. Their successes and lessons \\nlearned will be shared online and at conferences and meetings. FoodCORE centers are test \\nkitchens for new ideas to investigate and respond to outbreaks of enteric illness.

The HPV vaccine series is most \\neffective when given before a person is exposed to the virus. Every year in the United States, \\nHPV causes about 36,000 cases of cancer in both men and women. There are several types \\nof HPV vaccines. That's why HPV vaccine is recommended earlier rather than later. It \\nprotects your child long before they ever have contact with the virus. Gardasil-9 (9vHPV) is \\nthe vaccine distributed in the United States. This vaccine protects against nine HPV types (6, \\n11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58). In the past, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil, \\n4vHPV) and bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix, 2vHPV) were licensed by the U.S. Food and \\nDrug Administration (FDA). All of the HPV vaccines protect against HPV types 16 and 18 \\nthat cause most HPV cancers. Children ages 11?12 yearsshould get 2 doses of HPV vaccine, \\ngiven 6 to 12 months apart. HPV vaccines can be given starting at age 9. Only 2 doses are \\nneeded if the first dose was given before 15th birthday. Children 9?14 years oldwho have \\nreceived 2 doses of HPV vaccine less than 5 months apart will need a third dose. People \\n15?26years oldwho start the series later need 3 doses of HPV vaccine. People with \\nweakened immune systemsshould get 3 doses if they are 9?26 years old. People older than \\n26 years.Vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. HPV is a \\nvery common virus that can causecancerslater in life. About 13 million people, including \\nteens, become infected with HPV each year. You can protect your child from these cancers \\nwith HPV vaccine. Tell your doctor about any severe allergies. Some people should not get \\nsome HPV vaccines if they: HPV vaccines are safe for children who are mildly ill. This \\nincludes those with a low-grade fever of less than 101 degrees, a cold, runny nose, or cough. \\nPeople with a moderate or severe illness should wait until they are better.

Many people who get HPV vaccine have no side effects at all. Some people \\nreport having very mildside effects, like a sore arm from the shot. The most common side \\neffects of HPV vaccine are usually mild and include: To prevent fainting and injuries from \\nfainting, teens should be seated or lying down during vaccination; they should also do the \\nsame for 15 minutes after getting the shot. Your or your child?s doctor?s office is usually the \\nbest place to receive recommended vaccines. If your doctor does not stock HPV vaccine, ask \\nfor a referral. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health \\nclinics, health departments, or schools. You can contact your state health department to \\nlearn more about where to get HPV vaccine in your community. There are a few ways to \\ncover the cost of vaccines: Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, \\nyou may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. \\nCheck for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers. Your children may \\nbe able to get no-cost vaccines through theVaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This \\nprogram helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to \\nvaccines. HPV is a common virus that can cause certain cancers later in life.

There are several types \\nof genetic disorders. Some disorders are caused by a genetic change (mutation) in a single \\ngene; some are caused by an abnormality in one of the chromosomes; and some are \\ncomplex, involving numerous genes and influences from environmental factors. Genetic \\ndisorders are health problems that happen because of some type of abnormality in a \\nperson's genetic material. There are several types of genetic disorders. In some cases, a \\ngenetic change in a single gene can cause someone to have a disease or condition. In other \\ncases, the gene does not have a genetic change, but a person has more or fewer copies of the \\ngene than most people, and this causes a disease or condition. Some diseases or conditions \\noccur when a person does not have the same number of chromosomes as most people or \\nhas part of a chromosome that is missing, extra, or not in the right place. Most genetic \\ndisorders happen due to the combination of many genetic changes acting together with a \\nperson's behaviors and environment. These are sometimes called complex conditions. A \\ndetailed description of the basic concepts of genetics can be foundhere. DNA contains the \\ninstructions for making your body work. DNA is made up of two strands that wind around \\neach other. Each DNA strand includes chemicals called nitrogen bases?T (thymine), A \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 332, 'page_label': '415'}, page_content='(adenine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine)?that make up the DNA code. Genes are specific \\nsections of DNA that have instructions for making proteins. Proteins make up most of the \\nparts of your body and make your body work the right way. Some diseases and conditions \\nhappen when a person has a genetic change (sometimes called a mutation) in one of their \\ngenes. These types of diseases are called single gene disorders. Sometimes, what happens is \\nthat one of the DNA bases is changed. For example, part of a gene that usually has the \\nsequence TAC is changed to the sequence TTC. This can change the way the gene works, for \\nexample, by changing the protein that is made. In other cases, one or more of the bases in \\nthe DNA sequence are missing altogether, or there are extra bases. Genetic changes can be \\npassed down to a child from their parents. When this happens, the disease or condition is \\ncalled hereditary or inherited. Or the changes can happen for the first time in the process of \\nmaking the sperm or egg or early in development, so the child will have the genetic change \\nbut the parents will not. Single gene disorders that affect a gene on one of the 22 autosomal \\nchromosome pairs are called autosomal disorders. Disorders that affect the sex \\nchromosome are called X-linked disorders. Disorders are further described according to \\nwhether the affected genetic change is dominant or recessive. For some diseases and \\nconditions, everyone who inherits the genetic change will have the disease or condition, but \\nhow serious it is can vary from person to person. In other cases, people who have the \\ngenetic change will be more likely to develop the disease or condition, but some of them will \\nnever develop it. With autosomal dominant diseases or conditions, a person only needs a \\ngenetic change in one copy of the gene to have the disease. If one parent has an autosomal \\ndominant disease or condition, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the genetic \\nchange that causes the condition. Examples of autosomal dominant conditions include \\nhereditary breast and ovarian cancer caused by genetic changes (mutations) to \\ntheBRCA1andBRCA2genes;Lynch syndrome; andfamilial hypercholesterolemia. With \\nautosomal recessive diseases or conditions, a person needs a genetic change in both copies \\nof the gene to have the disease or condition. While a person with a genetic change in only \\none copy of the gene will not have the disease or condition, they can still pass the genetic \\nchange down to their children. These parents are sometimes called \"carriers\" of the disease \\nbecause they \"carry\" the genetic change that causes the disease or condition but do not have \\nthe disease themselves. A parent who is a carrier of a disease has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of \\npassing the gene with the genetic change on to each of their children. If both parents are \\ncarriers of the disease, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of inheriting two genes with the \\ngenetic change and thus of having the disease. Carrier screening looks for autosomal \\nrecessive genetic changes in parents to see if they could have a child with the disease or \\ncondition. Examples of autosomal recessive disorders aresickle celldisease andcystic \\nfibrosis. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X chromosome and one Y \\nchromosome. Each daughter gets an X from her mother and an X from her father. Each son \\ngets an X from his mother and a Y from his father. Some diseases or conditions happen \\nwhen a gene on the X chromosome has a genetic change. Because males only have one copy \\nof all the genes on the X chromosome, they are much more likely to be affected by X-linked \\ngenetic disorders than females. A female with a genetic change on only one of her two X \\nchromosomes may not have the disease or condition at all. However, in some cases, females '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 333, 'page_label': '416'}, page_content=\"with the genetic change on one of their X chromosomes can have the disease or condition, \\nbut it is often a milder form of the disease than usually occurs in males. Because males \\ninherit an X chromosome from their mother, a female with a genetic change on one copy of \\nthe gene has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of passing the genetic change on to each of her sons. Her \\nsons could have the disease or condition even though she does not. Examples of X-linked \\nconditions includefragile X syndrome,Duchenne muscular dystrophy, andhereditary \\nhemophilia. People usually have 23 pairs of chromosomes. But sometimes a person is born \\nwith a different number. Having an extra chromosome is called trisomy. Missing a \\nchromosome is called monosomy. For example, people withDown syndromehave an extra \\ncopy of chromosome 21. This extra copy changes the body's and brain's normal \\ndevelopment and causes intellectual and physical problems for the person. Some disorders \\nare caused by having a different number of sex chromosomes. For example, people \\nwithTurner syndromeusually have only one sex chromosome, an X. Women with Turner \\nsyndrome can have problems with growth and heart defects. Sometimes chromosomes are \\nincomplete or shaped differently than usual. Missing a small part of a chromosome is called \\na deletion. A translocation is when part of one chromosome has moved to another \\nchromosome. An inversion is when part of a chromosome has been flipped over. For \\nexample, people withWilliams syndromeare missing a small part of chromosome 7. This \\ndeletion can result in intellectual disability and a distinctive facial appearance and \\npersonality. Complex disorders are caused by genetic changes in many different genes \\nworking together with environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposures and \\nbehaviors such as air pollution, smoking, alcohol use, the amount of exercise a person gets, \\nor the foods they eat. Having a family health history of a complex condition can make you \\nmore likely to have that condition yourself. However, genetic testing would not be \\nrecommended because there is not a single genetic change causing the condition that could \\nbe found by genetic testing. Most chronic diseases, such as most cases ofheart \\ndisease,cancer,diabetes,osteoporosis, andasthma, are complex disorders. So are most cases \\nof developmental disabilities, such asautism spectrum disorderandattention deficit / \\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and mental health conditions, such \\nasdepressionandschizophrenia. The vast amount of genetic information available has \\nallowed researchers to develop methods to study which types of genetic changes are found \\nmore often in people with a given disease or condition. This allows researchers to estimate \\na person's risk for a particular disorder based on which genetic changes they have. This \\nestimate is known as the polygenic risk score. Some important issues need to be considered \\nbefore polygenic risk scores can be routinely used in health care and public health. Studies \\nare looking at how useful polygenic risk scores are in real-life clinical practice. Information \\non how each gene change affects disease risk comes from population-level genetic studies. \\nAddressing diversity in development of polygenic risk scores is important, because \\npolygenic risk scores developed from studies in one population (for example, people of \\nNorthern European ancestry) might not work as well for other populations (for example, \\npeople of West African ancestry).

This page provides information about basic genetic concepts \\nsuch as DNA, genes, chromosomes, and gene expression. DNA (which is short for \\ndeoxyribonucleic acid) contains the instructions for making your body work. DNA is made \\nup of two strands that wind around each other and looks like a twisting ladder (a shape \\ncalled a double helix). Each DNA strand includes chemicals called nitrogen bases, which \\nmake up the DNA code. There are four different bases, T (thymine), A (adenine), C \\n(cytosine), and G (guanine). Each base on one strand of DNA is paired with a base on the \\nother strand. The paired bases form the \"rungs of the DNA ladder\". The bases are in \\ndifferent orders on different parts of the DNA strand. DNA is \"read\" by the order of the \\nbases, that is by the order of the Ts, Cs, Gs, and As. The order of these bases is what is known \\nas the DNA sequence. The DNA in almost all living things is made up of the same parts. \\nWhat\\'s different is the DNA sequence. Genetic inheritance is the process of passing down \\nDNA from parents to children. Your genome is all of the DNA in your body. DNA is packaged \\ninto small units called chromosomes. A chromosome contains a single, long piece of DNA \\nwith many different genes. You inherit your chromosomes from your parents. \\nChromosomes come in pairs. Humans have 46 chromosomes, in 23 pairs. Children \\nrandomly get one of each pair of chromosomes from their mother and one of each pair from \\ntheir father. There are 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes, called autosomes, and the \\nchromosomes that form the 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes. They determine if a \\nperson is born a male or female. A female has two X chromosomes, and a male has one X \\nand one Y chromosome. Each daughter gets an X from her mother and an X from her father. \\nEach son gets an X from his mother and a Y from his father. Each chromosome has many \\ngenes. Genes are specific sections of DNA that have instructions for making proteins. \\nProteins make up most of the parts of your body and make your body work the right way. \\nYou have two copies of every gene. You inherit one copy from your father and one copy \\nfrom your mother. The genes people inherit from their parents can determine many things. \\nFor example, genes affect what a person will look like and whether the person might have \\ncertain diseases. Alleles are forms of the same gene that may have small differences in their \\nsequence of DNA bases. These differences contribute to each person\\'s unique features. Each \\nperson has two alleles for each gene, one from each parent. If the alleles of a gene are the \\nsame, the person is considered homozygous for the gene. If the alleles are different, the \\nperson is considered heterozygous for the gene. Most of the time, differences between \\nalleles do not have much of an effect on the protein that is made. However, sometimes \\ndifferent alleles can result in differences in traits, such as blood type. Some alleles are \\nassociated with health problems or genetic disorders. In these alleles, the differences in the \\nsequence of DNA bases affects the body\\'s ability to make a certain protein. Because your \\ngenes were passed down from your parents, you and your family members share many \\ngene alleles. The more closely related you are, the more gene alleles you have in common. \\nCells are the basic units of life. The human body contains trillions of cells. There are many \\ndifferent types of cells that make up the many different tissues and organs in the body. For \\nexample, skin cells, blood cells, heart cells, brain cells, and kidney cells are just a few of the \\ncell types that perform different vital functions in the body. The basic structure of a cell is a \\njelly-like substance known as cytoplasm, which is surrounded by a membrane to hold it '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 336, 'page_label': '419'}, page_content='together. Within the cytoplasm are various specialized structures that are important to the \\nwork of the cell. One of these structures is the cell nucleus, which contains the DNA \\npackaged in chromosomes. Gene expression refers to the process of making proteins using \\nthe instructions from genes. A person\\'s DNA includes many genes that have instructions for \\nmaking proteins. Additionally, certain sections of DNA are not part of a gene but are \\nimportant in making sure the genes are working properly. These DNA sections provide \\ndirections about where in the body each protein should be made, when it should be made, \\nand how much should be made. For the most part, every cell in a person\\'s body contains \\nexactly the same DNA and genes, but inside individual cells some genes are active (\"turned \\non\") while others are not. Differences in how genes are used (expressed) to make proteins \\nare why the different parts of your body look and work differently. For example, gene \\nexpression in the muscles is different from gene expression in the nerves. Gene expression \\ncan change as you age. Also, your behaviors, such as smoking or exercise, or exposures in \\nyour environment can affect gene expression. DNA methylation works by adding a chemical \\n(known as a methyl group) to DNA. This chemical can also be removed from the DNA \\nthrough a process called demethylation. Typically, methylation turns genes \"off\" and \\ndemethylation turns genes \"on.\" DNA methylation is one of the ways the body controls gene \\nexpression. Methylation and demethylation do not change the DNA code (the sequence of \\nthe DNA bases), but they help determine how much protein is made. A genetic change \\n(sometimes called a mutation, gene variant, or genetic variant) is a change in a DNA base \\nsequence. While not all genetic changes will cause problems, sometimes, changes in genes \\ncan lead to changes in proteins and then the proteins don\\'t work the way they are supposed \\nto. This can lead to disease. Some genetic changes can be passed on from parent to child \\n(inherited). These genetic changes occur in the germ cells, which are the cells that create \\nsperm or eggs. Genetic changes that occur in the other cells in the body (known as somatic \\ncells) do not get passed on to a person\\'s children. Genetic changes happen when new cells \\nare being made and the DNA is copied. Also, exposures, such as high levels of radiation, can \\ndamage the DNA and cause genetic changes. However, most exposures will not result in \\ngenetic changes because each cell in the body has a system in place to check for DNA \\ndamage and repair the damage once it\\'s found. Copy number variation (CNV) refers to a \\nfeature of the genome, in which various sections of a person\\'s DNA are repeated. While this \\nhappens in all people, the number of repeats (or copies) varies from one person to the next. \\nCNVs play an important role in creating genetic diversity in humans. However, some CNVs \\nare linked to diseases. Environmental factors include exposures related to where we live, \\nsuch as air pollution; behaviors, such as smoking and exercise; and other health-related \\nfactors, such as the foods that we eat. Epigenetics refers to the ways a person\\'s behaviors \\nand the environment can cause changes that affect the way the genes work. Epigenetics \\nturns genes \"on\" and \"off\" and thus is related to gene expression. Epigenetics change as \\npeople age, both as part of normal development and aging and because of exposure to \\nenvironmental factors that happen over the course of a person\\'s life. There are several \\ndifferent ways an environmental factor can cause an epigenetic change to occur. One of the \\nmost common ways is by causing changes to DNA methylation. DNA methylation works by \\nadding a chemical (known as a methyl group) to DNA. This chemical can also be removed '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 337, 'page_label': '420'}, page_content='from the DNA through a process called demethylation. Typically, methylation turns genes \\n\"off\" and demethylation turns genes \"on.\" Thus, environmental factors can impact the \\namount of protein a cell makes. Less protein might be made if an environmental factor \\ncauses an increase in DNA methylation, and more protein might be made if a factor causes \\nan increase in demethylation.

HSV-1 often \\ncauses oral herpes, which can result in cold sores or fever blisters on or around the mouth. \\nHowever, most people with oral herpes do not have any symptoms. Most people with oral \\nherpes get it during childhood or young adulthood from non-sexual contact with saliva. \\nGenital herpes is common in the United States (U.S.). In 2018, CDC estimates show there \\nwere 572,000 new genital herpes infections in the U.S. among people aged 14 to 49.1 Most \\npeople with genital herpes have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms. Mild symptoms \\nmay go unnoticed or be mistaken for other skin conditions like a pimple or ingrown hair. \\nBecause of this, most people do not know they have a herpes infection. Herpes sores usually \\nappear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. This is known as \\nhaving an \"outbreak\". The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or \\nmore to heal. Flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, body aches, or swollen glands) also may occur \\nduring the first outbreak. People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have \\nrepeated outbreaks, especially if they have HSV-2. However, repeat outbreaks are usually \\nshorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although genital herpes is a lifelong \\ninfection, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time. See your healthcare provider if \\nyou notice any of these symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI \\nor symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, \\nburning when peeing, or bleeding between periods. Herpes infection can cause sores or \\nbreaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. This provides a way for HIV to \\nenter the body. Even without visible sores, herpes increases the number of immune cells in \\nthe lining of the genitals. HIV targets immune cells for entry into the body. Having both HIV \\nand genital herpes increases the chance of spreading HIV to a HIV-negative partner during \\noral, vagina, or anal sex. You can get genital herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with \\nsomeone who has the infection. You can get herpes if you have contact with: You also can \\nget genital herpes from a sex partner who does not have a visible sore or is unaware of their \\ninfection. It is also possible to get genital herpes if you receive oral sex from a partner with \\noral herpes. You will not get herpes from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools. You also \\nwill not get it from touching objects, such as silverware, soap, or towels. If you have more \\nquestions about herpes, consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider. Yes. \\nOral herpes caused by HSV-1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals throughoral sex. \\nThis is why some cases of genital herpes are due to HSV-1. The only way to completely '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 338, 'page_label': '421'}, page_content='avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If you are sexually active, you can do the \\nfollowing things to lower your chances of getting genital herpes: Be aware that not all \\nherpes sores occur in areas that a condom can cover. Also, the skin can release the virus \\n(shed) from areas that do not have a visible herpes sore. For these reasons, condomsmay \\nnotfully protect you from getting herpes. If your sex partner(s) has/have genital herpes, you \\ncan lower your risk of getting it if: If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, prenatal care \\nvisits are very important. Some research suggest that a genital herpes infection may lead to \\nmiscarriage or make it more likely to deliver your baby too early. You can pass herpes to \\nyour unborn child before birth, but it more commonly passes during delivery. This can lead \\nto a deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid \\ngetting genital herpes during pregnancy. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had \\na genital herpes diagnosis or symptoms. Also tell them about any possible exposure to \\ngenital herpes. If you have genital herpes, you may need to take anti-herpes medicine \\ntowards the end of your pregnancy. This medicine may reduce your risk of having signs or \\nsymptoms of genital herpes when you deliver. At the time of delivery, your healthcare \\nprovider should carefully examine you for herpes sores. If you have signs or symptoms of \\ngenital herpes at delivery, a \\'C-section\\' is likely to occur. Your healthcare provider may \\ndiagnose genital herpes by simply looking at any sores that are present. Providers can also \\ntake a sample from the sore(s) and test it. If sores are not present, a blood test may be used \\nto look for HSV antibodies. Have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider \\nabout herpes testing and other STDs. Please note: A herpes blood test can help determine if \\nyou have herpes infection. It cannot tell you who gave you the infection or when you got the \\ninfection. There is no cure for genital herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent \\nor shorten outbreaks. A daily anti-herpes medicine can make it less likely to pass the \\ninfection on to your sex partner(s). If you have herpes, you should talk to your sex \\npartner(s) about their risk. Usingcondomsmay help lower this risk but it will not get rid of \\nthe risk completely. Having sores or other symptoms of herpes can increase your risk of \\nspreading the disease. Even if you do not have any symptoms, you can still infect your sex \\npartners. You may have concerns about how genital herpes will impact your health, sex life, \\nand relationships. While herpes is not curable, it is important to know that it is manageable \\nwith medicine. Daily suppressive therapy (i.e., daily use of antiviral medication) can lower \\nyour risk of spreading the virus to others. Talk to a healthcare provider about your concerns \\nand treatment options. A genital herpes diagnosis may affect how you will feel about \\ncurrent or future sexual relationships. Knowing how totalk to sexual partners about STIsis \\nimportant. Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with \\nsuppressed immune systems. If you touch your sores or fluids from the sores, you may \\ntransfer herpes to another body part like your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid \\nspreading herpes to another part of your body. If you do touch the sores or fluids, quickly \\nwash your hands thoroughly to help avoid spreading the infection. If you are pregnant, \\nthere can be problems for you and your unborn fetus, or newborn baby. See \"I\\'m pregnant. \\nHow could genital herpes affect my baby?\" for information about this.

TheGlobal Health Security Agenda (GHSA)aims to \\nstrengthen the world?s ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. \\nMore than 70 countries have signed onto the GHSA framework. The United States made a \\nstrong commitment to the initial five-year period of GHSA and continues to support its \\nstrategic priorities. GHSA 2024's targets are for countries to take greater ownership of \\nglobal health security efforts and improve health-security-related technical areas. To \\nmeasure countries' progress towards meeting GHSA goals, CDC and its partners developed \\ntheJoint External Evaluation (JEE). The JEE is a voluntary evaluation process that gives \\ncountries a starting point for improving their health security. Countries can use the JEE to \\nidentify their strengths and point out the most urgent needs within their health systems. \\nThis transparent, external evaluation process encourages countries to exchange vital \\ninformation and work together towards a safer, healthier world.

It is very common, especially among young people ages 15-24 \\nyears. Most women with gonorrhea do not have any symptoms. Even when a woman has \\nsymptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. \\nSymptoms in women can include: Men who do have symptoms may have: Rectal infections \\nmay either cause no symptoms or cause symptoms in both men and women that may \\ninclude: See your healthcare provider if you notice any of these symptoms. You should also \\nsee a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an \\nunusual sore, a smelly discharge, burning when peeing, or bleeding between periods. \\nSexually active people can get gonorrhea through vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a \\ncondom with a partner who has gonorrhea. If you are sexually active, have an honest and \\nopen talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for gonorrhea or \\nother STIs. You can get gonorrhea by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom \\nwith someone who has the infection. A pregnant person with gonorrhea can give the \\ninfection to their baby during childbirth. The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not \\nhave vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If you are sexually active, the following things can lower your \\nchances of getting gonorrhea: If you are pregnant and have gonorrhea, you can give the \\ninfection to your baby during delivery. This can cause serious health problems for your \\nbaby. If you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about getting thecorrect \\nexamination, testing, and treatment.

Do not share medicine for gonorrhea with anyone. Although medicine will stop \\nthe infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the disease. It is becoming \\nharder to treat some gonorrhea, asdrug-resistant strains of gonorrheaare increasing. Return \\nto a healthcare provider if your symptoms continue for more than a few days after receiving \\ntreatment. Wait seven days after finishing all medicine before having sex. You and your sex \\npartner(s) should avoid having sex until you have each completed treatment and your \\nsymptoms are gone. This will help prevent you and your partner(s) from giving or getting \\ngonorrhea again. Those with gonorrhea should be retested about three months after \\ntreatment of an initial infection, even if their partners received successful treatment. If \\nyou've had gonorrhea and took medicine in the past, you can still get it again. This happens \\nif you have sex without a condom with a person who has gonorrhea. Untreated gonorrhea \\ncan cause serious and permanent health problems. In women, untreated gonorrhea can \\ncausepelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Some of the complications of PID are: In men, \\ngonorrhea can cause a painful condition in the tubes attached to the testicles, which can, in \\nrare cases, lead to infertility. Rarely, untreated gonorrhea can also spread to your blood or \\njoints. This condition can be life-threatening. Untreated gonorrhea may also increase your \\nchances of getting or giving HIV.

It's only a matter of time until it becomes resistant \\nto the last available cure. Drug resistance, also referred to as antimicrobial resistance, \\nhappens when germs like bacteria and fungi develop the ability to resist, and even defeat, \\nthe drugs designed to kill them.  That means the germs are not killed and continue to grow. \\nGonorrhea has developed resistance to nearly all the antibiotics used for its treatment. We \\nare currently down to one last recommended and effective class of antibiotics, \\ncephalosporins, to treat this common infection. This is an urgent public health threat \\nbecause gonorrhea control in the United States largely relies on our ability to successfully \\ntreat the infection. Gonorrhea is skilled at outsmarting the antibiotics that are used to kill it. \\nFor this reason, we must continuously monitor for resistance and encourage the research \\nand development of new drugs for gonorrhea treatment. Surveillance for resistant \\ngonorrhea in the United States is conducted through several projects: the Gonococcal Isolate \\nSurveillance Project (GISP), the enhanced Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (eGISP), \\nand Strengthening the United States Response to Resistant Gonorrhea (SURRG). Antibiotic \\nsusceptibility testing is an activity common to each project. CDC also recommends that \\nisolates from certain infections be submitted to theCDC STD Labfor confirmation.

For questions about \\nreporting a suspected treatment failure or resistant case, please email:GCFAILURE@cdc.gov \\nCulture testing is when bacteria is first grown on a nutrient plate and is then exposed to \\nknown amounts of an antibiotic to determine the bacteria's susceptibility to the antibiotic. A \\nmajor challenge to monitoring emerging resistant gonorrhea is the substantial decline in \\nthe use of gonorrhea culture testing by many clinicians, as well as the reduced capability of \\nmany laboratories to perform the gonorrhea culture techniques required for antibiotic \\nsusceptibility testing. The decline in culture testing results from an increased use of newer \\nlaboratory technology, such as a diagnostic test called the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test \\n(NAAT). Currently, there is no well-studied, reliable technology that allows for antibiotic \\nsusceptibility testing from nonculture specimens. Increased laboratory culture capacity is \\nneeded. CDC recommends that all state and local health department labs maintain or \\ndevelop the capacity to perform gonorrhea culture, or form partnerships with experienced \\nlaboratories that can perform this type of testing. Seelab methods for gonorrhea testing. In \\n1993, ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, and two cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefixime) \\nwere the recommended treatments for gonorrhea. However, in the late 1990s and early \\n2000s, ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in Hawaii and the West Coast. By 2004, \\nciprofloxacin- resistant gonorrhea had significantly increased among men who have sex \\nwith men (MSM) leading to the discontinuation of the drug in this population. By 2006, \\nnearly 14% of gonorrhea samples were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin resistance \\nwas present in all regions of the country and in the heterosexual population. On April 13, \\n2007, CDC stopped recommending fluoroquinolones as empiric treatment for gonorrhea \\naltogether. The cephalosporins, either cefixime or ceftriaxone, were the only remaining \\nrecommended treatments. Similar to trends observed elsewhere in the world, CDC \\nobserved worrisome trends of decreasing cephalosporin susceptibility. To preserve \\ncephalosporins for as long as possible, CDC has updated itsSTI Treatment \\nGuidelinesfrequently since 2010. Currently, just one regimen is recommended as first-line \\ntreatment for gonorrhea: a single 500 mg dose of the injectable cephalosporin, ceftriaxone. \\nCDC continues to monitor resistance to cephalosporins and other drugs.

To study whether a new vaccine might \\nbe causing GBS, CDC compares the usual rate of GBS to the observed rate of GBS in \\nvaccinated people. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)is a rare disorder where the body?s \\nimmune system damages nerve. The damage to the nerves causes muscle weakness and \\nsometimes paralysis. While its cause is not fully understood, the syndrome often follows \\ninfection with a virus or bacteria. Most people fully recover from GBS, but some have \\npermanent nerve damage. Each year in the United States, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 \\npeople develop GBS. To study whether a new vaccine might be causing GBS, CDC compares \\nthe usual rate of GBS to the observed rate of GBS in vaccinated people. This helps to \\ndetermine whether a vaccine could be causing more cases. In response to a potential \\npandemic strain of a flu virus in 1976, there was a national campaign for people to get the \\nswine flu vaccination. Over 45 million people were vaccinated and there were increased \\nreports of GBS following vaccination. Those who received the 1976 swine flu vaccine had a \\nslight increased risk for developing GBS of approximately one additional case of GBS for \\nevery 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. Scientists have several theories about \\nthe cause, but the exact reason for this link remains unknown. CDC monitors GBS cases \\nduring each flu season. From data collected, the association between seasonal flu vaccine \\nand GBS has been found to vary from season to season. When there has been an increased \\nrisk, it has consistently been in the range of 1-2 additional GBS cases per million flu vaccine \\ndoses administered. Additional studies have been conducted on the risk of GBS following flu \\nvaccination. Results of these studies suggest that it is more likely that a person will get GBS \\nafter getting the flu than after vaccination. It is important to keep in mind flu infection can \\npotentially cause severe illness and death. The best way to prevent flu infection and its \\ncomplications is to get the flu vaccine. CDC monitors multiple vaccine safety systems to \\ndetermine if GBS is occurring more among those who are vaccinated than the general rate \\nof GBS in the population. Recent CDC studies based on data from theVaccine Safety Datalink \\n(VSD)and theVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)have found evidence \\nsuggesting an increased risk of GBS among adults 18 years and older after J&J/Janssen \\nCOVID-19 vaccination but not after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. CDC \\nwill continue to monitor for and evaluate reports of GBS occurring after COVID-19 \\nvaccination and will share more information as it becomes available. CDC and FDA closely \\nmonitor the safety of all vaccines. CDC and FDA are committed to monitoring the safety of \\nvaccines. Once vaccines are licensed or authorized by FDA for use in the United States, CDC, \\nFDA, and other federal agencies work together to monitor them using several safety \\nsystems.

Unfiltered drinking \\nwater from ponds or other stagnant surface water sources can contain near-microscopic \\ncrustaceans called copepods (tiny \"water fleas\") that are infected with Guinea worm larvae \\n(immature forms of the Guinea worm). People do not usually have GWD symptoms until \\nabout one year after infection. Then, a mature pregnant female worm full of larvae creates a \\nblister on the skin through which she will emerge and expel her larvae when she comes in \\ncontact with water. A few days to hours before the worm, which can measure up to 3 feet (1 \\nmeter) in length, comes out of the skin, a person may develop fever, swelling, and pain in \\nthe area. Most worms come out of people\\'s legs and feet, though worms can come out of \\nother body parts, too. Challenges People in remote rural communities who have GWD often \\nlack access to healthcare. When the adult female worm comes out of the skin, it can be very \\npainful, disabling, and take a long time to remove. The emerging worm can cause a wound \\nthat may develop a secondary infection. Anyone who consumes drinking water from a pond \\nor other stagnant water source contaminated with infected copepods is at risk for infection. \\nPeople\\'s risk for disease can vary. People do not get immunity after GWD, which means they \\ncan get it again. GWD transmission also has a seasonal pattern. Water contact triggers the \\nGuinea worm to release a milky white liquid that contains hundreds of thousands of \\nimmature larvae into the water. In ponds and other stagnant water sources, these larvae are \\nthen consumed by copepods. People might become infected with Guinea worms by \\nconsuming unfiltered drinking water from such water sources containing infected \\ncopepods. People and animals might also become infected by eating certain aquatic animals \\n(e.g., fish or frogs) that have swallowed infected copepods. People and animals infected with \\nGWD can then spread the disease when the worm matures and is ready to emerge from the \\nbody if they enter ponds and other stagnant water sources that others drink from. Guinea \\nworm is a disease that has been prioritized for eradication by the World Health \\nOrganization. There were an estimated 3.5 million Guinea worm cases occurring annually in \\n20 African and Asian countries in 1986, but today, through theGuinea Worm Eradication \\nProgram(GWEP), only a handful of countries continue to have the disease.GWEPundertakes \\nseveral water-related and other measures to prevent GWD: There is no drug to treat Guinea \\nworm infection. Once part of the worm begins to come out of the wound, it is important that \\nall of the worm is removed to prevent complications. Anti-inflammatory medicine can help \\nreduce pain and swelling, and antibiotic ointment can help prevent infections. There is no \\nvaccine to prevent Guinea worm infection. Guinea worm disease is considered a Neglected \\nTropical Disease. It is a parasitic infection spread by drinking water containing Guinea \\nworm larvae.

The safety of refilling or \"topping off\" containers of ABHS such as \\npump bottles, pocket-sized dispenser bottles and single-use wall-mounted dispensers of \\nABHS is not well studied. Safety risks associated with refilling or \"topping off\" containers of \\nABHS include: Therefore, refilling or \"topping off\" ABHS dispensers should only be \\nconsidered in accordance with manufacturer\\'s guidance and FDA regulations. Refilling or \\n\"topping off\" containers of liquid soap has been associated with outbreaks of pathogenic \\nbacteria. Soap should not be added to partially empty soap dispensers.2 Gloves are not a \\nsubstitute for hand hygiene. C. difficileis a spore-forming bacterium that can lead to a \\ncommon healthcare-associated infection causing severe diarrhea. Spores are an inactive \\nform of the germ and have a protective coating allowing them to live on surfaces for \\nmonths. The bacteria can be transferred to patients via the hands of healthcare providers \\nwho have touched a contaminated surface or item. This is recommended due to the \\ntheoretical increased efficacy of soap and water for removing spores from hands, although \\nevidence for this recommendation is limited. Proper use of gloves (in addition to a gown) to \\nreduce bioburden on the hands should be emphasized. Access to ABHS should not be \\nrestricted. Bacteria on the hands of surgeons can cause wound infections if present in the \\noperative field during surgery. Bacterial growth slows after preoperative scrubbing with an \\nantiseptic agent.

If you suspect hantavirus disease, see a physician \\nimmediately and mention a potential rodent exposure. A diagnosis can be reached through \\ntesting at a state laboratory or CDC. If you have any questions or concerns regarding \\nsubmitting a specimen or any public health emergency, please contact your state or local \\nhealth department or contact the CDC's Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100. \\nThere is no specific treatment for hantavirus infection. Patients should receive supportive \\ncare, including rest, hydration, and treatment of symptoms. HPS can cause breathing \\ndifficulties, and patients may need breathing support, such as intubation. Intubation is a \\nmedical procedure where a tube is placed in the lungs from the mouth to help the patient \\nget oxygen. HFRS can disrupt kidney function. Patients with HFRS may need dialysis to \\nremove toxins from the blood and maintain the right balance of fluids in the body when the \\nkidneys aren't working well.

They can quickly grow out of control, or \"bloom.\" Some of \\nthese blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick. Harmful algal \\nblooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also \\ngrow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see. Not all blooms \\nare harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the \\nenvironment if they: Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. \\nHowever, three types ?cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms?cause most blooms that \\nmake people and animals sick. Harmful algal blooms can grow in fresh water, salt water, or \\nbrackish water (a mixture of fresh and salt water). This includes water people use for \\nrecreation and for drinking. Harmful algal blooms occur across the world. In the United \\nStates, they have been reported in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \\nAlgae and cyanobacteria occur naturally in water. They are more likely to grow into a \\nharmful algal bloom when water is: Nutrients get into water when fertilizer, sewage, or \\nrunoff from cities and industrial buildings washes into lakes, rivers, or oceans. This can \\nhappen during rainstorms, for example. Environmental changes, such as warmer water, \\nmight be making harmful algal blooms worse. Learn more about factors that help harmful \\nalgal blooms grow. Harmful algal blooms cause a variety of mild to serious illnesses. \\nSymptoms depend on the type of harmful algal bloom you come in contact with and how \\nyou are exposed. People and animals can get sick from having contact with water or food \\nthat containscertain types of algae, cyanobacteria, or their toxins. You or your animals can \\nget sick if you: You can take steps to avoid getting sick from harmful algal blooms. For \\nexample: If you or your animal go in water with an algal bloom, rinse off with tap water \\nright after. If you think you have symptoms caused by a harmful algal bloom, contact a \\nhealthcare provider or thePoison Control hotlineat 1-800-222-1222. If your pets or \\nlivestock seem sick after going in or near water, contact a veterinarian right away. You can \\nalso call theASPCA Animal Poison Control Centerat 1-888-426-4435 or thePet Poison \\nHelplineat 1-855-764-7661. Note that there is a fee for these calls.

You can find them mostly on your head, but also on your eyebrows and \\neyelashes. Adult head lice are roughly 2 ? 3 mm long (about the size of a sesame seed). Both \\nover-the-counter and prescription medications are available to treat head lice in your hair \\n(infestation). People with head lice may not have symptoms, particularly with a first \\ninfestation or when an infestation is light. Itching (pruritus) is the most common symptom \\nof head lice infestation. It is caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites. It may take four to \\nsix weeks for itching to appear the first time a person has head lice. Other symptoms may \\ninclude the following: Head lice do not transmit any disease and therefore are not \\nconsidered a health hazard. In the United States, infestation with head lice is most common \\namong preschool- and elementary school-age children and their household members and \\ncaretakers. There is not reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the \\nUnited States; however, an estimated 6 ? 12 million infestations occur each year in the \\nUnited States among children 3 ? 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that girls get head \\nlice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact. In the \\nUnited States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African American \\npersons than among persons of other races. The head louse found most frequently in the \\nUnited States may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of \\nsome types of hair, but not others. Head lice mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of \\na person infested with lice. Head lice move by crawling; they cannot hop or fly. Adult lice \\ncan live on a person's head for about 30 days. However, they will die within two days if they \\nfall off a person and cannot feed. Adult female head lice are usually larger than males and \\ncan lay about six eggs each day. Nits (lice eggs) cannot hatch and usually die within a week if \\nthey are not kept at the same temperature as those found close to the scalp. Nits take about \\na week (range 6 ? 9 days) to hatch into nymphs (young lice). Nymphs look similar to adult \\nlice but are very small (size of a pinhead); they take about seven days to mature into adult \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 369, 'page_label': '452'}, page_content=\"lice. The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who \\nalready has head lice. This contact can be common among children playing at places like \\nschool or the home. Getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of you or your \\nenvironment. Although not as common, head lice may spread by: Contracting lice from a wig \\nor hairpiece is extremely unlikely. Especially if the wig or hairpiece hasn't been worn in the \\npast 48 hours by a person with head lice. Head lice can survive under water for several \\nhours but are unlikely to spread in a swimming pool. Chlorine levels in pool water do not \\nkill head lice. Animals do not get or spread head lice. Take these steps to help prevent and \\ncontrol the spread of head lice: To help control a head lice outbreak in a community, school, \\nor camp, teach children to avoid activities that may spread head lice. For example, teach \\nchildren to Misdiagnosis of head lice infestation is common. Finding a live nymph (baby \\nlouse) or adult louse on the scalp or hair is the best way to diagnose a head lice infestation. \\nBecause adult and nymph lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they may be \\ndifficult to find. A fine-toothed louse comb may help you find lice. If you do not see crawling \\nlice, look for nits attached firmly within ¼ inch of the base of hair shafts. You will often see \\nnits on hair behind the ears and near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than \\n¼ inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always hatched or dead. Although head lice \\nand nits can be visible with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice \\nor nits. Nits are often confused with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair \\nspray droplets, and dirt particles. If you do not see nymphs or adults, and the only nits \\nfound are more than ¼ inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and does not \\nneed treatment. Lice are parasites, or insects, found on people's heads and bodies, including \\nthe pubic area. Human lice survive by feeding on human blood.

As the federal government's leading public health agency, \\nCDC has a unique role in contributing to work on SDOH. Addressing differences in SDOH \\naccelerates progress towardhealth equity, a state in which every person has the opportunity \\nto attain their highest level of health. SDOH have been shown to have a greater influence on \\nhealth than either genetic factors or access to healthcare services. For example, poverty is \\nhighly correlated with poorer health outcomes and higher risk of premature death.ASDOH, \\nincluding the effects of centuries of racism, are key drivers of health inequities within \\ncommunities of color. The impact is pervasive and deeply embedded in our society, creating \\ninequities in access to a range of social and economic benefits?such as housing, education, \\nwealth, and employment. These inequities put people at higher risk of poor health. CDC is \\ncoordinating efforts to focus its resources on the areas where federal public health \\ninvestments can make the most difference. For example, CDC'sRacial and Ethnic Approaches \\nto Community Health (REACH)focuses on reducing high rates of chronic diseases for \\nspecific racial and ethnic groups in urban, rural, and tribal communities. Since 1999, the \\nprogram has worked across sectors in racial and ethnic minority communities to reduce \\ntobacco use, improve access to healthy foods, change the built environment to promote \\nphysical activity, and connect people to clinical care. Public health organizations can: Bring \\ntogether community members and organizations to identify local concerns. CDC has a long \\nhistory of convening partners through national conferences, webinars, collaborative \\npublications, and guideline development.

The virus is part of the same virus \\nfamily (Paramyxoviruses) asNipah virus. Pteropusbats,or \"flying fox\" bats, are the animal \\nthat maintains Hendra virus in nature. The virus has been found in all four species of \\nAustralian flying foxes. Flying foxes can infect horses with the virus when they bite the \\nhorses. Horses can also be infected if they are exposed to the urine, droppings, or saliva of \\nan infected bat. Spread from flying foxes to horses is limited to coastal and forested regions \\nin Australia (Queensland and New South Wales states). Horses can then spread the virus to \\npeople. Hendra infections in people remain rare; only seven cases have ever been reported. \\nSymptoms in people typically begin 9-16 days after they had contact with an infected horse. \\nHendra infection can cause lung problems with severe flu-like symptoms. In some cases, \\nillness may progress to brain swelling (encephalitis). Hendra infections are rare. However, \\nit leads to death in more than half of people who get it (57 percent). People at highest risk \\nare Hendra virus can spread to people after contact with tissues or excretions of infected '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 391, 'page_label': '474'}, page_content='horses, like blood, urine, or birthing materials. Horses may be infected after exposure to \\nvirus in the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected flying foxes. Infected bat urine or \\ndroppings can fall directly on the horse or in the food or water they\\'re consuming. To date, \\nno spread between people has been documented. Hendra infection in people has only been \\nlinked to infection of an a \"middleman\" animal, or intermediate host, like horses. Early \\ndetection of infections in horses is an important way limiting future Hendra infections in \\npeople. People in areas with Hendra virus or flying foxes can prevent illness with Hendra \\nvirus by: If someone must have contact with an infected horse, they should use personal \\nprotective equipment, like boots, gloves, protective eyewear, mask or respirator, and gown. \\nThere is a commercial vaccine licensed in Australia for horses. This could be beneficial for \\nother animal species that may be at risk for Hendra infection and eventually people. \\nLaboratory tests can diagnose Hendra infection. These tests include detection of antibody \\nby ELISA (IgG and IgM), real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and virus isolation \\nattempts. The same tests can detect Nipah virus. In most countries, Hendra virus should be \\nhandled in high- containment laboratories. Hendra or Nipah virus infection can be \\ndiagnosed during the acute and convalescent phases of the disease. This can be done with a \\ncombination of tests including The drug ribavirin has been shown effective against Hendra \\nand Nipah viruses in laboratory studies. However, it\\'s not clear how much help it would be \\nin patients sick with Hendra infection. An antibody drug that prevents Hendra and Nipah \\ninfection in people is in development in Australia. If it reaches final development, the \\ntherapy would be given to people who were exposed to Hendra virus and became sick. \\nHendra virus infection is a rare disease spread to people from infected horses.

The hepatitis A vaccine is the best way to prevent \\ninfection. Washing your hands often ? especially after using the bathroom, after changing \\ndiapers, and before preparing or eating food ? can also prevent the spread of hepatitis A. \\nThere are two types of hepatitis A vaccines: single-antigen and combination. The single-\\nantigen vaccine protects against hepatitis A and the combination vaccine protects against \\nboth hepatitis A and hepatitis B.

The potential risks of hepatitis A are much higher than any risks associated with \\nhepatitis A vaccine. Millions of doses of hepatitis A vaccine have been given since the first \\nhepatitis A vaccine was licensed in 1995. If you or a loved one can?t find vaccination \\nrecords, your doctor may recommend revaccination for hepatitis A. Extra doses of hepatitis \\nA vaccine are not harmful. There are no serious side effects from hepatitis A vaccines. The \\nmost common side effect is soreness in the area around the shot site. There are several \\nhepatitis A vaccines available in the United States, including: Talk to your doctor to \\ndetermine which vaccine is right for you.

Too much iron is toxic to the body, and over time the high levels of iron can damage \\ntissues and organs and lead to Symptoms of hemochromatosis include Many people with \\nhereditary hemochromatosis don't know they have it. Early symptoms of hemochromatosis, \\nsuch as feeling tired or weak, are common and can also be symptoms of a variety of other \\ndiseases. Hereditary hemochromatosis is most common among people with Northern \\nEuropean ancestry. Men with hereditary hemochromatosis are more likely to develop \\ncomplications than women, and men are often diagnosed at an earlier age. Hereditary \\nhemochromatosis is most commonly caused by certain changes in a specific gene, called \\ntheHFEgene. If you inherit two of these genetic changes (mutations), one from each parent, \\nyou have hereditary hemochromatosis and are at risk for developing high iron levels. \\nHowever, most people with hereditary hemochromatosis never develop symptoms or \\ncomplications. If you have a family member, especially a sibling, who is known to have \\nhereditary hemochromatosis, talk to your healthcare provider about genetic testing. A \\nblood test can be used to screen people who may have hemochromatosis by measuring how \\nmuch iron is in their blood. Affected people with or without a known family history of \\nhemochromatosis can be diagnosed through blood tests for excess iron in the body (called \\niron overload) followed by genetic testing. The earlier hemochromatosis is diagnosed, the \\nless likely you are to develop serious complications?many of which can cause permanent \\nproblems. If you have hemochromatosis, your healthcare provider may suggest ways to \\nlower the amount of iron in your body. If you are diagnosed with hemochromatosis, \\nregularly scheduled blood removal is the most effective way to lower the amount of iron in \\nyour body.

A person with HHT may form abnormal capillaries or abnormal capillary \\nconnections between the arteries and veins. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that pass \\nblood from arteries to veins. The abnormal blood vessels formed in HHT are often fragile \\nand can burst, causing bleeding. Men, women, and children from all racial and ethnic groups \\ncan be affected by HHT and experience the problems associated with this disorder, some of \\nwhich are serious and potentially life-threatening. Fortunately, if HHT is discovered early, \\neffective treatments are available. However, there is no cure for HHT. Nosebleeds are the \\nmost common sign of HHT, resulting from small abnormal blood vessels within the inside \\nlayer of the nose. Abnormal blood vessels in the skin can appear on the hands, fingertips, \\nface, lips, lining of the mouth, and nose as delicate red or purplish spots that lighten briefly \\nwhen touched. Bleeding within the stomach or intestines is another possible indicator of \\nHHT that occurs because of abnormal blood vessels lining the digestive tract. Additional \\nsigns of HHT include abnormal artery-vein connections within the brain, lungs, and liver, \\nwhich often do not display any warning signs before rupturing. HHT is a genetic disorder. \\nEach person with HHT has a gene that is altered (mutated), which causes HHT. It takes only \\none gene with a mutation to cause HHT. Hundreds of possible mutations in several different \\ngenes have been linked to HHT. HHT can be diagnosed by performing genetic testing. Most \\npeople with HHT are first diagnosed by using clinical criteria (presence of signs and a \\nhistory of signs in a parent, sibling, or child). The complications of HHT can vary widely, \\neven among people affected by HHT in the same family.

The hierarchy of controls is a way of determining which actions will \\nbest control exposures. The hierarchy of controls has five levels of actions to reduce or \\nremove hazards. The preferred order of action based on general effectiveness is: Using this \\nhierarchy can lower worker exposures and reduce risk of illness or injury. Elimination \\nremoves the hazardat the source. This could include changing the work process to stop \\nusing a toxic chemical, heavy object, or sharp tool. It is the preferred solution to protect \\nworkers because no exposure can occur. Substitutionis usinga safer alternativeto the source \\nof the hazard. An example is using plant-based printing inks as a substitute for solvent-\\nbased inks. When considering a substitute, it's important to compare the potential new risks \\nof the substitute to the original risks. This review should consider how the substitute will \\ncombine with other agents in the workplace. Effective substitutes reduce the potential for \\nharmful effects and do not create new risks. Elimination and substitutioncan be the most \\ndifficult actions to adopt into an existing process. These methods are best used at the design \\nor development stage of a work process, place, or tool. At the development stage, \\nelimination and substitution may be the simplest and cheapest option. Another good \\nopportunity to use elimination and substitution is when selecting new equipment or \\nprocedures.Prevention through Designis an approach to proactively include prevention \\nwhen designing work equipment, tools, operations, and spaces. Engineering controlsreduce \\nor prevent hazardsfrom coming into contact with workers.

To protect all women and infants, CDC recommends the \\nfollowing: Hepatitis B Virus Infection (HBV) All pregnant women should be screened during \\neach pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history \\nof testing. Pregnant people with a history of appropriately timed triple panel screening and \\nwithout subsequent risk for exposure to HBV (i.e., no new HBV exposures since triple panel \\nscreening) only need hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening. Testing pregnant \\npersons known to be chronically infected or immune enables documentation of the HBsAg \\ntest result during that pregnancy to ensure timely prophylaxis for exposed infants. \\nNewborns of pregnant persons who are HBsAg positive should receive the HepB vaccine \\nand HepB immune globulin at birth and complete the HepB vaccine series according to the \\nrecommended vaccination schedule. Hepatitis C Virus Infection (HCV) All pregnant women \\nshould be tested for hepatitis C during each pregnancy. While there is no treatment \\navailable to prevent transmission of HCV infection from mother to child, screening for HCV \\ninfection during pregnancy allows health care providers to identify infected persons who \\nshould receive treatment during the postpartum period and infants who should receive \\ntesting during a pediatric visit. Identification of HCV infection during pregnancy also can \\ninform pregnancy and delivery management issues that might reduce the risk of HCV \\ntransmission to the infant. HIV All pregnant women should be tested for HIV as early as \\npossible, preferably at the first prenatal visit. The earlier HIV is diagnosed and treated, the \\nmore effective HIV medicines ? called antiretroviral therapy or ART ? can be at preventing \\ntransmission and improving the health outcomes of both mother and child. Syphilis All \\npregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the first prenatal visit, ideally during the \\nfirst trimester of pregnancy. Among people who may be less likely to receive prenatal care, \\nconsider testing at the time of pregnancy testing. The earlier syphilis is diagnosed and \\ntreated during pregnancy, the more likely congenital syphilis and its complications (such as \\nstillbirth) can be prevented in the infant. Penicillin G is effective for preventing maternal \\ntransmission to the fetus, as well as treating fetal and maternal infection. Pregnant women \\nwho live in communities with high rates of syphilis, who are at high risk for syphilis \\nacquisition during pregnancy (e.g., substance use or a new sex partner), or who were not \\npreviously tested during the pregnancy should also be screened again at 28 weeks and at \\ndelivery. Tuberculosis (TB) Healthcare providers should assess all persons, including \\npregnant women, for risk factors associated withlatent TB infectionandTB disease. While \\nuniversal testing for latent TB infection and TB disease is not recommended for pregnant \\nwomen in the United States, targeted testing for those with risk factors, including people \\nliving with HIV infection, people born in high TB prevalence countries, and those who are \\nknown contacts of persons with TB disease, facilitates prompt initiation of curative \\ntreatment for those with TB disease. HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STIs, and Tuberculosis can have \\nserious consequences for pregnancy and babies. Prenatal screening for these infections is \\nrecommended.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that \\nlives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist \\nclimates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical \\ndiseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected \\npopulations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and \\neffective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in \\nthe affected communities. Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's \\nintestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when \\ninfected people defecate (poop) outside, useunimproved sanitation facilities(when there is \\nno sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as \\nfertilizer. Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites \\nglobally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. \\nThey may occur in temperate climates during warmer months. People who consume soil \\nwithAscarisor whipworm eggs in it can become infected with \\ntheAscarisorwhipwormparasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are: Ascarisand \\nwhipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil. People with only a few worms \\n(light infections) usually have no symptoms.

Only prescription drugs can \\ntreat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and \\nmebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and \\nthree days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your \\nhealthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite.

However, they can spread to humans through the skin. When they infect \\npeople, the hookworms can cause a disease called cutaneous larva migrans (CLM). People \\nbecome infected when young hookworms, known as larvae, burrow into unprotected skin. \\nThis can happen when people are walking barefoot or sitting (with exposed skin) on soil or \\nsand contaminated by animal feces. Zoonotic hookworm larva cause CLM by burrowing into \\nthe skin of a person\\'s foot or body. This burrowing can cause: These symptoms will go away \\nafter several weeks as the parasite dies. In rare cases, some types of hookworm may infect \\ndeeper tissue in the intestine, lungs, or possibly the eye. Cases of CLM often occur in people \\nwho have traveled to tropical regions where dog and cat hookworm larvae can survive in \\nthe soil. If you walk barefoot in soil or sand in these regions, you can get zoonotic \\nhookworm. However, you can find zoonotic hookworms anywhere in the world.

One of the best ways you can protect yourself from getting sick is to thoroughly \\nwash your hands after handling, cleaning up after, or feeding horses. Below are diseases \\nthat can be spread by horses. Before you interact with horses, be aware that they can \\nsometimes carry germs that can make people sick, even when they appear healthy and \\nclean. Always get routine veterinary care for your horse to keep it healthy and to prevent \\ninfectious diseases. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Be sure to \\nhave hand sanitizer readily available near the horse's stall to encourage others to use it \\nbefore handling the horse or its equipment. Kicks and bites from horses can cause serious \\ninjury and sometimes illness. Bites and kicks can spread germs, even if the wound does not \\nseem deep or serious. If you are injured by a horse, you should: Diseases can spread \\nbetween animals and people.

Tapeworms can cause digestive problems including abdominal pain, loss of \\nappetite, weight loss, and upset stomach. The most visible sign of taeniasis is the active \\npassing of proglottids (tapeworm segments) through the anus and in the feces. In rare \\ncases, tapeworm segments become lodged in the appendix, or the bile and pancreatic ducts. \\nTaenia saginatadoes not cause cysticercosis in humans. It is not clear ifT. asiaticacauses \\ncysticercosis in humans or not. Eating raw or undercooked contaminated beef or pork is the \\nprimary risk factor for acquiring taeniasis. Because of this, certain groups with dietary \\nrestrictions for these meats may have a lower risk of taeniasis. A disease \\ncalledcysticercosiscan occur whenT. soliumtapeworm eggs are ingested. For example, \\npeople with poor hygiene who have taeniasis?with or without symptoms?will shed \\ntapeworm eggs in their feces and might accidentally contaminate their environment. This \\ncan lead to transmission of cysticercosis to themselves or others unknowingly. One way to \\nprevent taeniasis is to cook meat to safe temperatures. A food thermometer should be used \\nto measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. Do not sample meat until it is cooked. \\nUSDA recommends the following for meat preparation. Cook to at least 145° F (63° C) as \\nmeasured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the \\nmeat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming. Cook to at least 160° F (71° C); \\nground meats do not require a rest* time. *According to USDA, \"A \\'rest time\\' is the amount \\nof time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, \\noven, or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed from the heat \\nsource, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys pathogens.\" \\nDiagnosis ofTaeniatapeworm infections is made by examination of stool samples; \\nindividuals should also be asked if they have passed tapeworm segments. Stool specimens \\nshould be collected on three different days and examined in the lab forTaeniaeggs using a \\nmicroscope. Tapeworm eggs can be detected in the stool 2 ? 3 months after the tapeworm \\ninfection is established. Tapeworm eggs ofT. soliumcan also infect humans, \\ncausingcysticercosis.

Hydrogen \\nfluoride can be made when other compounds with fluoride, such as ammonium fluoride, are \\nmixed with water. Hydrogen fluoride is used to make refrigerants (liquid used in \\nrefrigerators), herbicides, pharmaceuticals, high-octane gasoline, and fluorescent light \\nbulbs. It is also used to make materials like aluminum, metals, plastics, etching glass, and \\nelectrical components. 60% of the hydrogen fluoride used in manufacturing is to make \\nrefrigerants. Hydrogen fluoride goes easily and quickly through the skin and into the tissues \\nin the body. When it touches tissues in the body, it damages the cells and causes them to not \\nwork properly. The effects of hydrogen fluoride poisoning depend on the amount, how \\nsomeone was exposed, and how long they were exposed. It also depends on the person's age \\nand if the person had any medical conditions. Showing these signs and symptoms does not \\nnecessarily mean that a person has been exposed to hydrogen fluoride. Other chemicals can \\nalso cause these effects. Hydrogen fluoride gas, even at low levels, can irritate the eyes and \\nrespiratory tract (mouth, throat, lungs, nose). Breathing in hydrogen fluoride at high levels \\ncan cause death from an irregular heartbeat or from fluid buildup in the lungs. Depending \\non the amount of hydrogen fluoride and how long it touches the skin, hydrogen fluoride \\nmay cause the following: Even small splashes of high levels of hydrogen fluoride in it can \\nlead to death. Skin contact with hydrogen fluoride may not cause immediate pain or visible \\nskin damage. Severe pain may be the only symptom for a few hours. Visible damage may not \\nappear until 12 to 24 hours after the exposure.

It does not always give off a smell, and not everyone can \\nsmell it. Breathing in cyanide gas causes symptoms to show up the fastest, but swallowing \\nsolid or liquid cyanide can be dangerous too. These symptoms can happen during or right \\nafter someone is exposed: If exposed to large amounts, signs and symptoms include: These \\nsymptoms can happen very quickly when exposed to a large amount of cyanide. These \\nsymptoms can happen with any type of exposure (breathing in, skin or eye contact, or \\nswallowing). If cyanide is in the water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking the \\nwater. If cyanide is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or \\nbreathing in the cyanide gas. If solid cyanide is put into water, it can make hydrogen cyanide \\ngas (HCN or AC). This can increase chances of breathing in the gas. Cyanide gas is most \\ndangerous in enclosed places where gas will be trapped. \\nCyanide gas can spread quickly in open spaces depending on the weather. less harmful \\noutdoors. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN or AC) gas is lighter than air, so the gas will rise. \\nCyanogen Chloride (CNCl or CK) is heavier and will sink to lower areas and increase the risk \\nof exposure there.

It can be a colorless gas or a fuming liquid, which \\nmeans it creates gas vapors. It can also be dissolved in water. \\nWhen hydrogen fluoride is dissolved in water, it may be called hydrofluoric acid. Hydrogen \\nfluoride can be made when other compounds with fluoride, such as ammonium fluoride, are \\nmixed with water. Hydrogen fluoride is used to make refrigerants (liquid used in \\nrefrigerators), herbicides, pharmaceuticals, high-octane gasoline, and fluorescent light \\nbulbs. It is also used to make materials like aluminum, metals, plastics, etching glass, and \\nelectrical components. 60% of the hydrogen fluoride used in manufacturing is to make \\nrefrigerants. Hydrogen fluoride goes easily and quickly through the skin and into the tissues \\nin the body. When it touches tissues in the body, it damages the cells and causes them to not \\nwork properly. The effects of hydrogen fluoride poisoning depend on the amount, how \\nsomeone was exposed, and how long they were exposed. It also depends on the person's age \\nand if the person had any medical conditions. Showing these signs and symptoms does not \\nnecessarily mean that a person has been exposed to hydrogen fluoride. Other chemicals can \\nalso cause these effects. Hydrogen fluoride gas, even at low levels, can irritate the eyes and \\nrespiratory tract (mouth, throat, lungs, nose). Breathing in hydrogen fluoride at high levels \\ncan cause death from an irregular heartbeat or from fluid buildup in the lungs. Depending \\non the amount of hydrogen fluoride and how long it touches the skin, hydrogen fluoride \\nmay cause the following: Even small splashes of high levels of hydrogen fluoride in it can \\nlead to death.

Most people \\nwith HCM are born with what appears to be a normal heart and develop HCM later. Those \\nwho develop HCM before age 40 often have more symptoms and complications.5 HCM \\nsometimes runs in families. In such cases, a child of an affected parent has a 50% (1 in 2) \\nchance of having HCM.6Other family members also have an increased chance of having \\nHCM. Importantly, the age at which other family members develop HCM can vary within \\nfamilies. When collecting yourfamily health historyto assess your risk for HCM HCM is \\ncaused by changes in genes that control the production of heart muscle proteins.6You only \\nneed a change in one copy of the gene to develop HCM. If someone in your family has been \\ndiagnosed with HCM, that person can havegenetic testingto look for genetic changes that \\ncause HCM. Testing in your family should start with someone who has HCM. In cases in \\nwhich a young person died suddenly, genetic testing might have been done as part of the \\nautopsy. Once the genetic change that causes HCM is found in a person, other family \\nmembers can have genetic testing for that change. If genetic testing does not find a genetic \\nchange that causes HCM in the affected family member, they should follow up with their \\ncardiologist (heart healthcare provider) on a regular basis. Sometimes genetic testing finds \\na genetic change that is not known to cause HCM at the time, but future studies show that it \\ncauses HCM. Also, further genetic testing might be recommended to include any newly \\nidentified genetic changes that cause HCM that were not included in earlier testing. If \\ngenetic testing shows that you have the genetic change for HCM, you will need to see a \\ncardiologist to check your heart for signs of HCM. If the genetic change that causes HCM in \\nyour family is not known, parents, siblings, and children of the person with HCM will need \\nto be checked for signs of HCM.

These antibodies can help protect your \\nbaby from those diseases during the first few months of life. Did you know a baby can get \\nsome disease protection from their mom during pregnancy? Gettingflu,Tdap (tetanus, \\ndiphtheria, and pertussis),respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),andCOVID-19vaccines while \\nyou're pregnant helps your body createprotective antibodies (proteins produced by the \\nbody to fight off diseases), and you can pass on those antibodies to your baby. These \\nantibodies can help protect your baby from those diseases during the first few months of \\nlife. CDC and a panel of experts who make vaccine recommendations have concluded that \\nflu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccines are not harmful for pregnant people and their babies. \\nThese experts carefully reviewed the available safety data before recommending any \\nvaccines during pregnancy. Vaccines, like medicine, can have side effects. But most people \\nwho get vaccinated have mild or no side effects.CDC continually monitors vaccine safety, \\nand the most common side effects of these vaccines include fever, tiredness, and body \\naches, as well as redness, swelling, and tenderness at the site where the shot was given. \\nYou'll need a Tdap vaccine during your pregnancy, with optimal timing between the 27th \\nthrough 36th week of each pregnancy, preferably during the earlier part of this time period. \\nTdap helps protect againstwhooping cough (pertussis), whichcan be life-threatening for \\nnewborns. About half of babies younger than 1 year old who get whooping cough need \\ntreatment in the hospital. The younger a baby is when they get whooping cough, the more \\nlikely the baby will need to be treated in a hospital. While some babies cough a lot, other \\nbabies with whooping cough don't cough at all. Instead, it can cause them to stop breathing \\nand turn blue. Siblings, parents, or caregivers who don't know they have whooping cough \\ncan infect babies since the disease often causes only mild symptoms in older children and \\nadults. Changes in your immune, heart, and lung functions during pregnancy make you \\nmore likely to get seriously ill from flu. Pregnancy increases the risk of being hospitalized \\nwith the flu and having flu-related complications if you get sick with the flu. Flu may also be \\ndangerous for your pregnancy. Fever during pregnancy, for any reason, has been associated \\nwith adverse pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, babies are more likely to get very sick from \\nflu. Flu vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older. When you get \\na flu vaccine during pregnancy, you pass antibodies along to your baby that can help protect \\nthem from flu in the first few months after they're born, when they are too young to be \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 432, 'page_label': '515'}, page_content=\"vaccinated themselves. Get a flu shot if you are pregnant during flu season?it's the best way \\nto protect yourself and your baby from flu. Flu vaccine is safe during pregnancy and can be \\ngiven during any trimester. RSVis a common cause of severe respiratory illness in infants. \\nBabies infected with RSV can have difficulty breathing and eating and sometimes may need \\nrespiratory support or hydration in the hospital. There are two ways to protect your baby \\nfrom getting very sick with RSV. You can choose to get RSV vaccine during weeks 32 \\nthrough 36 of your pregnancy during September to January, or your baby aged 8 months or \\nyounger can get RSV immunization during their first RSV season. If you are pregnant or \\nwere recently pregnant, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 than people \\nwho are not pregnant. Additionally, if you have COVID-19 during pregnancy, you are more \\nlikely to have complications that can affect your pregnancy and developing baby. COVID-19 \\nvaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, including people who \\nare pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in \\nthe future.Evidenceshows that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe \\nand effective and suggests that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any known or potential \\nrisks. New data show that vaccination during pregnancy can help protect babies younger \\nthan 6 months old, when they are too young to be vaccinated themselves, from \\nhospitalization due to COVID-19. Everyone, including people who are pregnant, should \\nstayup to datewith their COVID-19 vaccines, including getting an updated vaccine when it's \\ntime to get one. You know all about timing. Week after week, you are tracking your baby's \\ngrowth and development and counting down the days until you meet your little one! When \\nit comes to vaccines, timing is also important. Newborns do not yet have fully developed \\nimmune systems, making them particularly vulnerable to infections.Older kids and adults \\ncan spread viruses to babies, even if they don't feel very sick. Because of this, anyone who is \\naround babies should be up to date on all recommended vaccines. This includes parents, \\nsiblings, and any other caregivers, like grandparents, or babysitters. Anyone who needs \\nvaccines should get them at least two weeks before meeting the baby because it takes about \\ntwo weeks to develop antibodies after vaccination. The amount of antibodies you have in \\nyour body after getting vaccinated decreases over time. When you get a vaccine during one \\npregnancy, your antibody levels may not stay high enough to provide enough protection \\nduring future pregnancies, even if your babies are close in age. So, make sure you give baby \\nnumber 2 (and 3 and 4?) the greatest amount of protective antibodies and the best disease \\nprotection possible by getting your Tdap vaccine each time you are pregnant. You should \\nalso get a flu shot every flu season, and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.

EBV is also known as human herpesvirus 4 and is a member of the herpes \\nvirus family. Most people will get infected with EBV in their lifetime, especially in childhood, \\nand will not have symptoms. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms, or \\nthe symptoms are not distinguishable from other mild, brief childhood illnesses. Symptoms \\nof EBV infection can include: People who get symptoms from EBV infection, usually \\nteenagers or adults, get better in 2 to 4 weeks.  However, some people may feel fatigued for \\nseveral weeks or even months. After you get an EBV infection, the virus becomes latent \\n(inactive) in your body. In some cases, the virus may reactivate. This does not always cause \\nsymptoms, but people withweakened immune systemsare more likely to develop symptoms \\nif EBV reactivates. EBV is most commonly spread through saliva by: The virus probably \\nsurvives on an object at least as long as the object remains moist. EBV can also spread \\nthrough blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ \\ntransplantations. There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection. You can help protect \\nyourself by reducing contact with people who have EBV infection. Make sure youavoid: \\nDiagnosing EBV infection can be challenging because the symptoms are similar to other \\nillnesses. EBV infection can be confirmed with a blood test that detects antibodies. About 9 \\nout of 10 adults have antibodies that show that they have a current or past EBV infection. \\nMost people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. There is no specific treatment for EBV. However, \\nsome things can be done to help relieve symptoms such as: Clinical Overview of Epstein-\\nBarr Virus (EBV) EBV is one of the most common human viruses and spreads through \\nbodily fluids, primarily saliva.

It has important information about infertility, including \\ncommon misconceptions, risk factors, and treatment options. For couples hoping to become \\nparents, difficulty conceiving a baby can be frustrating and unexpected. Many couples who \\nstruggle with infertility do end up having children, sometimes with medical help. An \\nimportant early step is understanding possible causes of infertility. For public health data \\ncollection, infertility is defined as not being able to get pregnant (conceive) after 1 year (or \\nlonger) of unprotected sex. Fertility in women is known to decline steadily with age. As a \\nresult, some providers evaluate and treat women aged 35 years or older after 6 months of \\nunprotected sex. These definitions of infertility are not intended to guide recommendations \\nabout the provision of fertility care services to individuals or families. Both men and women \\ncan contribute to infertility. Individuals and couples who are unable to conceive a child \\nshould consider making an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist. This is a \\nhealth care provider who specializes in managing infertility. Pregnancy is the result of a \\nprocess that has many steps. To get pregnant: Infertility may result from a problem with \\nany or several of these steps. Impaired fecundity is a condition related to infertility. It refers \\nto women who have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term. \\nReproductive endocrinologists may also be able to help women with recurrent pregnancy \\nloss, defined as having two or more spontaneous miscarriages. Yes. In the United States, 1 in \\n5 (19%) of married women aged 15 to 49 with no prior births are unable to get pregnant \\nafter 1 year of trying. About 1 in 4 (26%) of women in this group have difficulty getting \\npregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term. Women need functioningovaries,fallopian tubes, \\nand auterusto get pregnant. Conditions affecting any one of these organs can contribute to \\nfemale infertility. A woman'smenstrual cycleis on average 28 days long. Regular, predictable \\nperiods that occur every 21 to 35 days likely reflectovulation. A woman with irregular \\nperiods is likely not ovulating. Ovulation can be predicted by using an ovulation test or \\nblood test. Disruption in ovarian function may be caused by several conditions and calls for \\nan evaluation by a health care provider. No single test is a perfect predictor of fertility, but \\nthere are tests for common markers of ovarian function. These include follicle-stimulating \\nhormone (FSH), anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), and antral follicle count (AFC) tests. Some \\nconditions that may cause issues related to ovarian function include the following: Fallopian \\ntubescan be evaluated by various methods, including with a hysterosalpingogram or by \\nchromopertubation. Risk factors for fallopian tube obstruction include: Theuterusmay be \\nevaluated by transvaginal ultrasound to look for various problems. A sonohystogram or \\nhysteroscopy may also be performed to evaluate the uterine environment. Problems that \\naffect the physical characteristics of the uterus include: Female fertility is known to decline \\nwith: Infertility in men can be caused by disruption of testicular or ejaculatory function, as \\nwell as by hormonal and genetic disorders. It is typically evaluated by a semen analysis, \\ncomplete medical history, and physical examination. This assessment helps determine if \\nand how male factors are contributing to infertility. A semen analysis assesses the number \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 442, 'page_label': '525'}, page_content='(concentration), motility (movement), and morphology (shape) of sperm. The results are \\nthen evaluated by a specialist. If semen is found to be slightly abnormal, it does not \\nnecessarily mean that a man is infertile. Some conditions that can disrupt testicular or \\nejaculatory function include the following: Improper function of the hypothalamus or \\npituitary glands are hormonal disorders that can cause infertility. These glands produce \\nhormones that maintain normal testicular function. Too much of these hormones, especially \\nprolactin, can result in infertility. Other conditions that damage or impair the hypothalamus \\nor the pituitary gland may also result in low or no sperm production. Examples of hormonal \\ndisorders include: Genetic conditions can cause no sperm or low numbers of sperm to be \\nproduced. Examples of genetic disorders include: Male fertility is known to decline with: \\nHealth care providers will collect a thorough medical and sexual history from both partners. \\nInitial evaluation can include tests that are appropriate based on the couple?s specific \\ncircumstances. These tests may include:  a semen analysis, tubal evaluation, and ovarian \\nreserve testing. It is a good idea for couples to talk to a health care provider before trying to \\nget pregnant. Providers can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby. They can also \\nanswer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving. Learn more aboutabout planning \\nfor pregnancy. There are a variety of treatment options for infertility. The type of treatment \\noffered depends on the cause of infertility, its duration, and your age. Your health care \\nprovider may need to perform preliminary testing to determine the best treatment option \\nfor you. A couple\\'s treatment preferences after they have received counseling about success \\nrates, risk factors, and benefits of each option also determine how their infertility is treated. \\nTreatment options for infertility may include timed intercourse, medications, intrauterine \\ninsemination, surgery, or assisted reproductive technology. Timed intercourse?with or \\nwithout?medication is often the first option for many couples who are trying to conceive. It \\nmay be recommended for couples where the male has normal or close to normal sperm \\ncount and motility (movement), the female has open (or functioning) fallopian tubes, and \\nthe couple is physically able to have intercourse. With timed intercourse, a couple tracks the \\nwoman\\'s ovulation and has intercourse around the time of ovulation. If a woman ovulates \\nnormally on her own, she may not need to take medication. Otherwise, she may need to take \\nmedication (orally or through injection) to stimulate ovulation. There are a variety of \\nmedications used to treat infertility in women. Many fertility medications increase a \\nwoman\\'s chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with \\nmultiples may have more problems during pregnancy and are at higher risk of being born \\nprematurely (too early). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental \\nproblems. Your health care provider may talk with you about strategies to reduce the risk of \\nmultiple births while using infertility medications. Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an \\ninfertility treatment that is sometimes referred to as \"artificial insemination.\" During this \\nprocedure, specially prepared sperm are inserted into the woman\\'s uterus. This treatment \\nmay be recommended for couples in which the male has close to normal sperm count and \\nmotility (movement) and the ability to produce a semen sample in the office (or, under \\nsome circumstances, at home) and the woman has open, functioning fallopian tubes. This \\ntreatment may be appropriate for couples: Surgical treatments for fertility are rare because \\nof the success of other treatments, such as Intrauterine insemination (IUI) and In vitro '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 443, 'page_label': '526'}, page_content=\"fertilization (IVF). Surgery may be recommended to women with certain diagnoses to \\nincrease the likelihood of conceiving. Examples include removing fibroids surgically from \\nthe uterus with a procedure called a myomectomy or surgery to treat blocked fallopian \\ntubes. Men may also be offered surgery for specific diagnoses, such as varicoceles. Assisted \\nreproductive technology (ART)includes all fertility treatments in which either eggs or \\nembryos are handled outside of the body. The main type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF). \\nIn general, ART procedures involve removing eggs from a woman's ovaries using a needle. \\nThese eggs are then combined with sperm in the laboratory to create embryos. The \\nembryos are returned to the woman's body, frozen for future use, or donated to another \\nwoman. A variation of ART, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), is often used for \\ncouples with male factor infertility. With ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a mature egg. \\nPreimplantation genetic testing can be used during ART to identify genetic disorders or \\nchromosomal abnormalities in embryos. One or more cells are biopsied from each embryo \\nand sent for testing. ART can be expensive and time-consuming. Despite these challenges, \\nART has helped many couples have children that otherwise would not have been conceived. \\nSuccess rates after IVF vary and depend on many factors. They can include the clinic \\nperforming the procedure, the infertility diagnosis, and the age of the woman undergoing \\nthe procedure. The woman's age is especially important. CDC publishesART success ratesfor \\nall fertility clinics in the United States. In addition, CDC created anIVF Success Estimatorto \\nhelp estimate the chance of having a live birth using IVF based on the experiences of women \\nand couples with similar characteristics. The most common complication of ART is a \\nmultiple pregnancy. This can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos \\nthat are transferred back to the uterus. For example, transfer of a single embryo greatly \\nreduces the chances of a multiple pregnancy. Using a single embryo, rather than multiple \\nembryos, lowers risks such aspreterm birth. ART procedures sometimes involve the use of \\ndonor eggs, donor sperm, or donated embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes used for women \\nwho cannot produce eggs. Donor eggs or donor sperm are sometimes used for other \\nreasons, such as a genetic disease that can be passed on to the baby. An infertile couple may \\nalso use donated embryos that were created by other couples in infertility treatment and \\nwere not used. When donated embryos are used, the child will not be genetically related to \\neither parent. Donor eggs, donor sperm, or donated embryos may also be used by same-sex \\ncouples. A gestational carrier (surrogate) carries an embryo that was formed from the egg \\nof another woman with the expectation of returning the infant to its intended parents. \\nWomen who have no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. Women who cannot \\nbecome pregnant, or who have a serious health problem and should not become pregnant \\nmay also consider this option.

For example, unsafe injection practices can occur during: Unsafe injection \\npractices can be a serious threat to your health. Unsafe injections can spread diseases \\nlikehepatitis C,hepatitis B, bacterial and fungal diseases, and possiblyHIVif injection \\nequipment, like needles or syringes, is reused on more than one patient or to access vials \\nthat are shared between patients. Most healthcare providers follow safe injection practices. \\nThough not common, unsafe injection practices sometimes occur. When unsafe injection \\npractices occur, providers should notify possibly affected patients and inform them to get \\ntested. To learn more about safe injection practices, talk to your healthcare provider. \\nAsyringeis an instrument used to inject fluids into the body or draw them from the body. \\nHealthcare providers should only use a syringe once, then discard it. Aneedleis a sharp \\npointed object used for injection or removal of fluid from the body. Healthcare providers \\nshould only use a needle once, then discard it. Asingle-dose vialis a bottle of liquid \\nmedication healthcare providers give to a patient using a needle and syringe. A single-dose \\nvial is approved for use on a single patient for a single procedure or injection. Amulti-dose \\nvialis a bottle of liquid medication that contains more than one dose of medication and is \\nrecognized by its FDA-approved label. Healthcare providers use multi-dose vials to deliver a \\nvariety of medications and vaccines. If handled safely, they can be accessed for more than \\none patient. Healthcare providers should always use a new needle and syringe when \\naccessing the contents of a multi-dose vial. Reuse of needles or syringes can contaminate \\nmedicine with germs, which can spread to others. Unsafe injection practices can be a \\nserious threat to patient and healthcare worker health.

It's so important that you can't live without it. Here's how insulin works when \\neverything is working properly: Insulin also signals your liver to store extra blood sugar as \\nenergy for later. If you haven't eaten recently, your liver releases stored blood sugar so \\nenergy is always available. Sometimes this finely tuned system can get out of balance. When \\nyour body is exposed to too much blood sugar over an extended period of time, you can \\ndevelop insulin resistance. Here's what that means: High blood sugar is damaging to the \\nbody, so your body keeps trying to remove excess blood sugars. It stores extra sugar in your \\nliver and muscles. When they're full, the liver sends the remaining sugar to be stored as \\nbody fat, causing weight gain. Insulin resistance sets the stage for prediabetes and type 2 \\ndiabetes. You can't tell if someone has insulin resistance by looking at them. Although \\noverweight and obesity are risk factors, you donothave to have them to have insulin \\nresistance. Other risk factors for insulin resistance include: Talk to your doctor if you think \\nyou might have insulin resistance, or want to find out more. If you have insulin resistance, \\nthere's good news. You can reverse it by making your cells more sensitive to insulin. \\nPhysical activitymakes you more sensitive to insulin, one reason it's important for diabetes \\nmanagement (and good health in general!). Don't wait until you're diagnosed with \\nprediabetes or type 2 diabetes to start moving more. The earlier you take action, the better \\noff you'll be. Weight lossif you have overweight or obesity is another great way to relieve \\nstrain on your body and increase your insulin sensitivity. Eating a balanced dietwith non-\\nstarchy vegetables, fruits, whole grains and lean proteins helps to reduce your blood sugar. \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 455, 'page_label': '538'}, page_content=\"This will decrease the amount of insulin your pancreas releases to help reverse insulin \\nresistance.

Transportation carriers might \\nhave additional requirements (e.g., breed restrictions for pets traveling in cargo, health \\ncertificates), so travelers intending to take pets outside the United States should contact air \\nand cruise lines for information as soon as they are aware of their travel plans. The US \\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) \\nlistsinternational export regulations for pets. Pet owners are responsible for making sure \\nrequirements of the destination country are met. USDA APHIS often is required to endorse a \\nhealth certificate prior to an animal leaving the United States; certificates must be accurate, \\ncomplete, and legible. Failure to meet destination country requirements can cause problems \\ngaining certificate endorsement or difficulties upon arrival in the destination country (e.g., \\nanimal quarantine or retesting). Travelers should be aware that long flights can be hard on \\npets, particularly older animals, animals with chronic health conditions, very young animals, \\nand short-nosed breeds (e.g., Persian cats, English bulldogs) that can be predisposed to \\nrespiratory stress. The US Department of Transportation offers tips fortraveling with \\nanimals by plane. The Department of Justice (DOJ) Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) \\ndefines a service animal as any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks \\nfor the benefit of a person with a disability, including an intellectual, mental, physical, \\npsychiatric, or sensory disability. DOJ does not recognize emotional support animals as \\nservice animals, and airline carriers are not required to recognize emotional support \\nanimals as service animals.

Food irradiation is safe, and its safety \\nand efficacy have been endorsed by federal agencies and intergovernmental organizations. \\nFood irradiation works by exposing food toionizingelectromagnetic (gamma or x-ray) \\nradiation. Food irradiation is considered a \"cold\" method, meaning it does not use heat to \\nkill germs. Other food safety processes that you may be more familiar with, like \\npasteurization and canning, use heat. The irradiation process happens after a food is \\nproduced and packaged. Food enters a chamber where it is exposed to a specific amount of \\nradiation. The radiation penetrates the food and kills germs or prevents them from \\nmultiplying, and it does not linger in the food. Irradiation is one more protective step, but it \\ndoes not replace other food safety measures. Irradiation can make foods safer that are \\ntypically eaten raw, like some produce. Irradiation can also make raw foods that you cook at \\nhome, like ground beef, safer to handle. That\\'s because irradiation kills most of the germs in \\nthe food before you buy it. Think of food irradiation as an added layer of protection against \\nharmful germs that can make you sick. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has \\napproved food irradiation as a safe and effective process. Food irradiation has been \\nevaluated for safety for over 30 years.  \\nMany agencies and organizations have endorsed its safety and effectiveness including: Even \\nastronauts eat irradiated food! All irradiated foods must display the Radura symbol to let \\nconsumers know that the product has been treated with irradiation. Labels may also say \\n\"Treated with Radiation\" or \"Treated by Irradiation.\" For more detailed information on '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 463, 'page_label': '546'}, page_content=\"labeling, please visit theFDA irradiation page. FDA has approved a variety of foods for \\nirradiation. Approved foods include: You can ask the stores where you shop if they sell \\nirradiated foods. Irradiated foods do not lose a significant amount of nutrients during the \\nprocess. Nutrient loss during irradiation is similar to the amount of nutrients lost during \\ncooking, freezing, canning, and other food safety methods. Irradiated foods do not become \\nradioactive, meaning they do not give off radiation. Eating irradiated foods does not expose \\nyou to or contaminate you with radiation or radioactive materials. During the food \\nirradiation process, beams of radiation pass through the food in the same way that X-ray \\nbeams pass through you when you get a medical X-ray. After you receive an X-ray, you are \\nnot radioactive, and no additional radiation or radioactive materials remain inside or \\noutside your body. Similarly, after food is irradiated it does not have any additional \\nradiation or radioactive materials inside or outside the food.

Correctional health also includes the health of families and \\ncommunities of persons who are justice system-involved, as well as the health \\nadministrators and staff who work in facilities. Persons who are justice system-involved are \\nmore likely to experience risk factors for HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections \\n(STIs), tuberculosis (TB), latent TB infection (LTBI), andtraumatic brain injuries (TBI) and \\nconcussions. The prevalence of these infections, diseases, and injuries is higher than in the \\ngeneral population. Additionally, a high proportion of people with justice system \\ninvolvement have a history of unstable housing and mental health and substance use \\ndisorders, which increases vulnerability and risk for HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, \\ntuberculosis/latent tuberculosis infection, and injuries like TBI. This puts many in need of \\nlinkage to substance use and mental health treatment, employment, and permanent housing \\nupon release. Justice-involvement also leads to family and community instability \\nandadverse childhood events, with 1 in 28 children having a caregiver who is incarcerated. \\nTaken together, these multiple health conditions andsocial determinates of \\nhealthcontribute to the health disparities found in this population and their communities. \\nCDC has worked to provide people who are justice system-involved, correctional facility \\nstaff, public health professionals, community organizations, and anyone else with an \\ninterest in correctional health with data, testing and treatment guidelines, educational \\nmaterials, and other correctional health resources.

Leishmaniasis \\nis a neglected tropical disease (NTD). There are several different forms of leishmaniasis in \\npeople: Signs and symptoms can vary based on the form of leishmaniasis. People may or \\nmay not experience signs and symptoms. Those who develop symptoms have one or more \\nskin sores, which can change in size and appearance over time. The skin sores usually \\ndevelop within a few weeks or months of the sand fly bite. The sores are often painless. ML \\nis a form of leishmaniasis that affects the mucous membranes (most commonly the nose, \\nbut also the mouth and throat). ML can be a consequence of infection with some of the types \\nof parasites that cause CL in parts of Central and South America and, rarely, other places. VL \\nis another form of leishmaniasis caused by a small number ofLeishmaniaspecies. People \\nwith VL may develop fever, generalized illness, and anemia (low red blood cells). VL often \\ngoes on to affect internal organs (especially the spleen, liver, and bone marrow) and can be \\nlife threatening. People with VL usually become sick within months (though it can be years) \\nof the sand fly bite. If untreated, VL is typically deadly. Anyone who lives in or travels to an \\narea whereLeishmaniaparasites occur and is bitten by an infected sand fly is at risk for \\nleishmaniasis. It is usually more common in rural areas but can also occur in the outskirts of \\nsome cities. Dusk to dawn is the time when people are most likely to be bitten. \\nLeishmaniasis occurs in parts of approximately90 countries, usually in tropical or \\nsubtropical climates. Most cases of leishmaniasis that are diagnosed in the US are in people \\nwho were infected while traveling or living in other countries. Occasionally, people have \\nhad locally acquired CL, especially in Texas and rarely other states (e.g., Oklahoma and \\nArizona). There have been no known cases of acquired VL in the US. The main way people \\nget infected with leishmaniasis is through the bite of an infected female sand fly. People may \\nnot notice the bites because sand flies are silent, very small, and the bites can be painless for \\nmany people. On average, sand flies that transmit the parasite are only about one fourth the \\nsize of mosquitoes (sometimes even smaller). Sand flies are usually most active at twilight, \\nevening, and nighttime hours (dusk to dawn). Some species ofLeishmaniaparasites can also \\nbe spread via contaminated needles (needle sharing) or blood transfusions. There have also \\nbeen reports of congenital transmission (mother passing an infection to her baby during \\npregnancy or at birth). There are no vaccines or drugs to prevent leishmaniasis. The best '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 469, 'page_label': '552'}, page_content=\"way to prevent infection is to protect yourself from sand fly bites throughpreventive \\nmeasures. Even if you already had leishmaniasis, it is possible to get it again. Therefore, it is \\nimportant to follow preventive measures. If you have traveled or lived in a part of the world \\nwhere leishmaniasis occurs and have symptoms, talk to your healthcare provider. CDC staff \\ncan advise your healthcare provider and help with laboratory testing for leishmaniasis. \\nYour healthcare provider will test tissue samples from skin sores (for CL) or from bone \\nmarrow (for VL) to examine for diagnosis. Blood tests can be helpful for VL. CDC staff can \\nadvise your healthcare provider on whether your case of leishmaniasis should be treated, \\nand if so, with what type of treatment. Different types of treatment are available for CL and \\nthe choice of treatment depends on multiple factors, including the species \\nofLeishmaniaparasite involved. In some cases, skin sores from CL might heal on their own \\nwithout treatment depending on the species involved.Leishmaniaskin sores can take \\nmonths to years to heal and the sores can leave significant scars. For theLeishmaniaspecies \\nthat cause ML, it is important to have proper treatment in order to prevent mucosal tissue \\ndestruction in the nose, mouth, or throat. Without treatment, ML can be life threatening if it \\naffects the throat. It is important to recognize and treat VL early. If not treated, severe \\n(advanced) cases of VL are typically deadly. In people with compromised immune systems \\n(e.g., HIV, malnutrition), VL can be difficult to treat.

It was produced in 1918 to be used in World War I. However, its production was too \\nlate for it to be used in the war. As a vesicant or blistering agent, it causes blistering of the \\nskin and mucous membranes (eyes, nose, throat, etc.) on contact. Lewisite is an oily, \\ncolorless liquid in its pure form and can appear amber to black in its impure form. \\nIt has a smell like geraniums and contains arsenic, a poisonous element. Lewisite is not \\nfound naturally in the environment. It is used only as a chemical warfare agent and has no \\nmedical or other practical use. Lewisite is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that \\nimmediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory (breathing) tract. Because it contains \\narsenic, lewisite has some effects that are similar to arsenic poisoning, including stomach \\nillness and low blood pressure. Effects of lewisite depend on the amount people are exposed \\nto, how they are exposed, and how long they are exposed. Most information on the health \\neffects of lewisite is based on animal studies. Signs and symptoms happen immediately after \\nlewisite exposure. Lewisite has different effects on specific parts of the body. Showing these \\nsigns and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to lewisite. \\nPain and irritation can start within seconds to minutes. Within 15 to 30 minutes, redness \\ncan begin. Within several hours, blisters can appear. The blister begins as a small blister in \\nthe middle of the red areas. The blister then grows to cover the entire reddened area. The \\nlesions (sores) from lewisite heal much faster than lesions caused by the other blistering \\nagents (sulfur mustardandnitrogen mustards). The discoloring of the skin that occurs later \\nis much less noticeable as well. Signs and symptoms of contact with eyes include: \\nRespiratory (breathing) tract signs and symptoms include: Digestive tract signs and \\nsymptoms include: Cardiovascular (heart-related system) signs and symptoms include \\n\"Lewisite shock\" or low blood pressure.

Lewisite gas is heavier than air, so it \\nwill settle in lower areas. Lewisite is a liquid under a wide range of environmental \\nconditions, from below freezing to very hot temperatures. Therefore, it could last for a long \\ntime in the environment. If lewisite gas is released into the air, people may be exposed \\nthrough skin contact or eye contact. They may also be exposed by breathing air that \\ncontains lewisite. If lewisite liquid comes into contact with food, people may be exposed by \\neating the contaminated food. People may be exposed by drinking water that contains \\nlewisite or by getting the water on their bodies. Get fresh air by leaving the area where the \\nlewisite is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death \\nfrom lewisite. If lewisite was released outside, move away from the area. Go to the highest \\nground possible, because lewisite is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas. If lewisite \\nwas released indoors, get out of the building. Remove the clothing with liquid lewisite as \\nquickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping \\nothers, do not touch unsafe areas and take off the clothes quickly. As quickly as possible, \\nwash any liquid lewisite from your skin with lots of soap water. Washing with soap and \\nwater will protect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your \\nvision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear \\ncontacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in \\nyour eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with \\nsoap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. If possible, put \\nthe clothing in a plastic bag. Then put the first plastic bag in a second plastic bag. Throwing \\naway your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be \\non your clothes. If you placed your clothes in plastic bags, tell the local or state health \\ndepartment or emergency personnel when they arrive. Do not handle the plastic bags. \\nTreatment involves removing lewisite from the body as soon as possible and providing \\nsupportive medical care in a hospital. An antidote (cure for poisons) for lewisite is available \\nand is most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure. Breathing in large amounts of \\nlewisite gas may cause long-term respiratory (breathing) disease. If the eye is exposed for a \\nlong time, it may cause permanent blindness. Lewisite is not known to affect the immune \\nsystem. Severe skin burning is also less likely.

LLS is a service-learning, multidimensional \\nprogram that encompasses the competencies of applied public health laboratory research, \\nlaboratory operations and quality management, the science of biosafety, bioinformatics, \\nadvanced communications, and leadership training. The program guides fellows through 10 \\ncore activities of learning (CALs) to help build skill sets in these competency areas deemed \\ncritical for success as a laboratory leader. LLS fellows hone their leadership skills and create \\na culture of scientific excellence in laboratory science by emphasizing high standards in \\nareas such as laboratory quality, safety, and service to protect the public?s health, safety, \\nand security. LLS is closely aligned with CDC?s Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) to \\npromote interdisciplinary training, applied learning, and collaboration between laboratory \\nscientists and epidemiologists. LLS provides opportunities for fellows to serve public health \\nagencies and learn through field experiences and domestic or international emergency \\nresponses. CDC?s guiding principles for laboratory work are to ensure the safety of all staff \\nand the community. CDC prioritizes transparency as we conduct high-quality scientific \\nresearch to promote health and protect people in this country and around the world. LLS \\nwas established as one of multiple efforts to promote lab safety and quality practices and \\nprocedures across the agency. A goal of establishing LLS was to strengthen the culture of \\nlaboratory quality and safety at CDC. Since its launch, the LLS program has expanded \\ntraining beyond laboratory quality management and the science of biosafety to also include \\nprogram management, bioinformatics, advanced communications, and leadership. \\nVisitCDC's laboratory safetywebsite to stay informed on laboratory safety efforts.

It is spread by the \"multimammate rat\" orMastomys \\nnatalensis(Mastomys), which is found throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, only West \\nAfrican multimammate rats are known to carry Lassa virus. Lassa fever is found in parts of \\nWest Africa, including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. People who live in \\nneighboring countries are also at risk because the rat that spreads Lassa fever lives \\nthroughout the region. The first documented case occurred in 1969. Lassa fever is named \\nafter the town in Nigeria where the first cases occurred. About 8 in 10 people who are \\ninfected have mild symptoms and are not diagnosed. Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever \\ntypically occur 1 to 3 weeks after a person is infected. Lassa fever can lead to hearing loss, \\nwith about 1 out of 3 cases experiencing various levels of deafness. Deafness can occur in \\nboth mild and severe cases of Lassa fever. In many cases, the hearing loss is permanent. If a \\npregnant person is infected, there is a high risk of miscarriage. In these cases, about 95% of \\nfetuses do not survive. Although Lassa fever is found in West Africa, there\\'s a risk of Lassa \\nvirus infection wherever the multimmamate rat is found. Lassa fever is caused by infection \\nwith the Lassa virus, which is spread by rodents. These rodents breed quickly and carry the \\nvirus in their urine and droppings. They often live in areas where peoples\\' food supplies are \\nstored. People mostly get Lassa fever by eating or breathing in the virus, for example: \\nInfection can also occur after coming in contact with the body fluids of an infected person. \\nPeople with Lassa fever are not contagious until after their symptoms begin. Lassa fever is '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 483, 'page_label': '566'}, page_content=\"not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, shaking hands, or sitting near someone. \\nThe Lassa virus can spread in health care settings when not using proper personal \\nprotective equipment (PPE) or properly sterilizing equipment. If you go to West Africa, \\nprevent Lassa fever by keeping away from rats. You can also: Healthcare providers caring \\nfor patients with Lassa fever, should take precautions like: Diagnosing Lassa fever can be \\ndifficult because symptoms vary and are similar to symptoms caused by other diseases. \\nHealthcare workers should contact their health department if they suspect Lassa fever in a \\nreturning traveler. Diagnostic testing can be done in a laboratory with a high level of \\nbiosafety and enhanced infection prevention and control precautions. The ability to \\ndiagnose Lassa fever in areas where it is commonly found can be difficult. This is due to \\nlimited laboratory capacity to test patient samples easily and safely. Ribavirin, an antiviral \\ndrug, has been used to successfully treat patients with Lassa fever. It is most effective when \\ngiven soon after a patient becomes sick. Patients should also receive supportive care, \\nincluding rest, hydration, and treatment of symptoms. Learn about Lassa fever, how it \\nspreads, where it's found, and how to protect yourself.

People are exposed to lead by eating lead paint chips, ingesting contaminated food \\nor water, and/or by breathing in lead dust. Children younger than 6 years are more likely to \\nbe exposed due to their hand-to-mouth behavior. Many children ingest lead dust by putting \\nobjects such as toys and dirt in their mouths.

Even low levels of lead in blood are associated with developmental delays, \\ndifficulty learning, and behavioral issues. Theeffectsof lead poisoning can be permanent and \\ndisabling. There are steps that parents and healthcare providers can take toprotect children \\nfrom lead exposure. Healthcare providers can perform a blood lead test if a child was or \\nmay have been exposed to lead. CDC uses ablood lead reference value(BLRV) of 3.5 \\nmicrograms per deciliter (µg/dL). This reference level helps identify children with BLLs \\nhigher than most children's levels. CDC estimates that approximately 500,000 children in \\nthe United States have BLLs at or above the BLRV. Healthcare providers can use \\nCDC'sRecommended Actions Based on Blood Lead Levelto develop a plan of action for their \\npatient. More information about sources of exposure, risk factors, testing and prevention is \\nprovided below. Some children are at a greater risk for lead exposure from paint, water, \\nsoil, some imported items and industrial sources. They may also be exposed through their \\nparents and caregivers from certain jobs and hobbies. Children can be exposed to lead \\nwhere they live, learn, and play. Sources of lead exposure can include the following: The \\ngoal of CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) is toprevent \\nchildhood lead exposurebefore any harm occurs. Through CLPPP, CDC supportsstate and \\nlocal public health departmentswith funds for surveillance and prevention of lead exposure. \\nA blood lead test is the best way to determine if a child has been exposed to lead. Parents \\ncan talk to their healthcare provider to find out if ablood lead testis needed. Healthcare \\nproviders can recommendfollow-up actions and care based on the child's BLL. To find out if \\na home has lead, hire a certified lead inspector to test for lead.

Leishmaniasis \\nis a neglected tropical disease (NTD). There are several different forms of leishmaniasis in \\npeople: Signs and symptoms can vary based on the form of leishmaniasis. People may or \\nmay not experience signs and symptoms. Those who develop symptoms have one or more \\nskin sores, which can change in size and appearance over time. The skin sores usually \\ndevelop within a few weeks or months of the sand fly bite. The sores are often painless. ML \\nis a form of leishmaniasis that affects the mucous membranes (most commonly the nose, \\nbut also the mouth and throat). ML can be a consequence of infection with some of the types \\nof parasites that cause CL in parts of Central and South America and, rarely, other places. VL \\nis another form of leishmaniasis caused by a small number ofLeishmaniaspecies. People \\nwith VL may develop fever, generalized illness, and anemia (low red blood cells). VL often \\ngoes on to affect internal organs (especially the spleen, liver, and bone marrow) and can be \\nlife threatening. People with VL usually become sick within months (though it can be years) \\nof the sand fly bite. If untreated, VL is typically deadly. Anyone who lives in or travels to an \\narea whereLeishmaniaparasites occur and is bitten by an infected sand fly is at risk for \\nleishmaniasis. It is usually more common in rural areas but can also occur in the outskirts of \\nsome cities. Dusk to dawn is the time when people are most likely to be bitten. \\nLeishmaniasis occurs in parts of approximately90 countries, usually in tropical or \\nsubtropical climates. Most cases of leishmaniasis that are diagnosed in the US are in people \\nwho were infected while traveling or living in other countries. Occasionally, people have \\nhad locally acquired CL, especially in Texas and rarely other states (e.g., Oklahoma and \\nArizona). There have been no known cases of acquired VL in the US. The main way people \\nget infected with leishmaniasis is through the bite of an infected female sand fly. People may \\nnot notice the bites because sand flies are silent, very small, and the bites can be painless for \\nmany people. On average, sand flies that transmit the parasite are only about one fourth the \\nsize of mosquitoes (sometimes even smaller). Sand flies are usually most active at twilight, \\nevening, and nighttime hours (dusk to dawn). Some species ofLeishmaniaparasites can also \\nbe spread via contaminated needles (needle sharing) or blood transfusions. There have also \\nbeen reports of congenital transmission (mother passing an infection to her baby during \\npregnancy or at birth). There are no vaccines or drugs to prevent leishmaniasis. The best \\nway to prevent infection is to protect yourself from sand fly bites throughpreventive \\nmeasures. Even if you already had leishmaniasis, it is possible to get it again. Therefore, it is \\nimportant to follow preventive measures. If you have traveled or lived in a part of the world \\nwhere leishmaniasis occurs and have symptoms, talk to your healthcare provider. CDC staff '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 488, 'page_label': '571'}, page_content='can advise your healthcare provider and help with laboratory testing for leishmaniasis. \\nYour healthcare provider will test tissue samples from skin sores (for CL) or from bone \\nmarrow (for VL) to examine for diagnosis. Blood tests can be helpful for VL. CDC staff can \\nadvise your healthcare provider on whether your case of leishmaniasis should be treated, \\nand if so, with what type of treatment. Different types of treatment are available for CL and \\nthe choice of treatment depends on multiple factors, including the species \\nofLeishmaniaparasite involved. In some cases, skin sores from CL might heal on their own \\nwithout treatment depending on the species involved.Leishmaniaskin sores can take \\nmonths to years to heal and the sores can leave significant scars. For theLeishmaniaspecies \\nthat cause ML, it is important to have proper treatment in order to prevent mucosal tissue \\ndestruction in the nose, mouth, or throat. Without treatment, ML can be life threatening if it \\naffects the throat. It is important to recognize and treat VL early. If not treated, severe \\n(advanced) cases of VL are typically deadly. In people with compromised immune systems \\n(e.g., HIV, malnutrition), VL can be difficult to treat.

It is usually more common in rural areas but can also occur in the outskirts of \\nsome cities. Dusk to dawn is the time when people are most likely to be bitten. \\nLeishmaniasis occurs in parts of approximately90 countries, usually in tropical or \\nsubtropical climates. Most cases of leishmaniasis that are diagnosed in the US are in people \\nwho were infected while traveling or living in other countries. Occasionally, people have \\nhad locally acquired CL, especially in Texas and rarely other states (e.g., Oklahoma and \\nArizona). There have been no known cases of acquired VL in the US. The main way people '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 489, 'page_label': '572'}, page_content=\"get infected with leishmaniasis is through the bite of an infected female sand fly. People may \\nnot notice the bites because sand flies are silent, very small, and the bites can be painless for \\nmany people. On average, sand flies that transmit the parasite are only about one fourth the \\nsize of mosquitoes (sometimes even smaller). Sand flies are usually most active at twilight, \\nevening, and nighttime hours (dusk to dawn). Some species ofLeishmaniaparasites can also \\nbe spread via contaminated needles (needle sharing) or blood transfusions. There have also \\nbeen reports of congenital transmission (mother passing an infection to her baby during \\npregnancy or at birth). There are no vaccines or drugs to prevent leishmaniasis. The best \\nway to prevent infection is to protect yourself from sand fly bites throughpreventive \\nmeasures. Even if you already had leishmaniasis, it is possible to get it again. Therefore, it is \\nimportant to follow preventive measures. If you have traveled or lived in a part of the world \\nwhere leishmaniasis occurs and have symptoms, talk to your healthcare provider. CDC staff \\ncan advise your healthcare provider and help with laboratory testing for leishmaniasis. \\nYour healthcare provider will test tissue samples from skin sores (for CL) or from bone \\nmarrow (for VL) to examine for diagnosis. Blood tests can be helpful for VL. CDC staff can \\nadvise your healthcare provider on whether your case of leishmaniasis should be treated, \\nand if so, with what type of treatment. Different types of treatment are available for CL and \\nthe choice of treatment depends on multiple factors, including the species \\nofLeishmaniaparasite involved. In some cases, skin sores from CL might heal on their own \\nwithout treatment depending on the species involved.Leishmaniaskin sores can take \\nmonths to years to heal and the sores can leave significant scars. For theLeishmaniaspecies \\nthat cause ML, it is important to have proper treatment in order to prevent mucosal tissue \\ndestruction in the nose, mouth, or throat. Without treatment, ML can be life threatening if it \\naffects the throat. It is important to recognize and treat VL early. If not treated, severe \\n(advanced) cases of VL are typically deadly. In people with compromised immune systems \\n(e.g., HIV, malnutrition), VL can be difficult to treat.

The disease can affect the \\nnerves, skin, eyes, and lining of the nose. In some cases, body parts may lose their sense of \\ntouch and pain, increasing the likelihood of injuries such as cuts and burn. Despite the \\ndisease being hard to catch and completely curable, a lot of stigma and prejudice remains \\nagainst those who have Hansen's disease. Individuals affected by the disease often face \\nsocial isolation and discrimination, particularly in regions where the illness is prevalent. \\nSymptoms mainly affect the skin, nerves, and lining of the nose. The bacteria that causes \\nHansen's disease grows very slowly. After contact with the bacteria, it may take up to 20 \\nyears for someone to develop signs of the disease. In the United States, Hansen's disease is \\nrare.

You may be at risk for the disease if you live in a country where the disease \\nis widespread. According to WHO data from 2019: Healthcare providers can diagnose \\nHansen's disease by conducting an exam and running diagnostic tests, like skin biopsies. \\nThey may look for patches of skin that may look lighter, darker, or redder than the person's \\nnormal skin and determine if those patches have a loss of feeling. To confirm the diagnosis, \\nhealthcare providers will take a skin or nerve sample to look for the bacteria that cause \\nHansen's disease under the microscope. They may also do tests to rule out other skin \\ndiseases. Hansen's disease is treated with a combination of antibiotics. Treatment usually \\nlasts between one to two years. The illness can be cured if treatment is completed as \\nprescribed. In the U.S., people with Hansen's disease may be treated at specialized clinics \\nrun by theNational Hansen's Disease. There are several federally supportedoutpatient \\nclinicsthroughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Fact:Hansen?s disease does not spread easily \\nfrom person to person. You cannot get it through casual contact such as shaking hands, \\nsitting next to, or talking to someone who has the disease. Fact:Hansen's disease is curable. \\nPeople being treated for Hansen's disease can live a normal life among their family and \\nfriends and can continue to attend work or school. Fact:Fingers and toes do not just ?fall off? \\ndue to Hansen's disease. The bacteria that cause the disease attacks the nerves of the fingers \\nand toes, causing them to become numb. Injuries like burns, ulcers, and cuts on numb parts \\ncan go unnoticed, which may lead to permanent damage or infection, causing loss of the \\ndigit.

It was produced in 1918 to be used in World War I. However, its production was too \\nlate for it to be used in the war. As a vesicant or blistering agent, it causes blistering of the \\nskin and mucous membranes (eyes, nose, throat, etc.) on contact. Lewisite is an oily, \\ncolorless liquid in its pure form and can appear amber to black in its impure form. \\nIt has a smell like geraniums and contains arsenic, a poisonous element. Lewisite is not \\nfound naturally in the environment. It is used only as a chemical warfare agent and has no \\nmedical or other practical use. Lewisite is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that \\nimmediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory (breathing) tract. Because it contains \\narsenic, lewisite has some effects that are similar to arsenic poisoning, including stomach \\nillness and low blood pressure. Effects of lewisite depend on the amount people are exposed \\nto, how they are exposed, and how long they are exposed. Most information on the health \\neffects of lewisite is based on animal studies. Signs and symptoms happen immediately after \\nlewisite exposure. Lewisite has different effects on specific parts of the body. Showing these \\nsigns and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to lewisite. \\nPain and irritation can start within seconds to minutes. Within 15 to 30 minutes, redness \\ncan begin. Within several hours, blisters can appear. The blister begins as a small blister in \\nthe middle of the red areas. The blister then grows to cover the entire reddened area. The \\nlesions (sores) from lewisite heal much faster than lesions caused by the other blistering \\nagents (sulfur mustardandnitrogen mustards). The discoloring of the skin that occurs later \\nis much less noticeable as well. Signs and symptoms of contact with eyes include: \\nRespiratory (breathing) tract signs and symptoms include: Digestive tract signs and '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 493, 'page_label': '576'}, page_content='symptoms include: Cardiovascular (heart-related system) signs and symptoms include \\n\"Lewisite shock\" or low blood pressure. People\\'s risk for exposure depends on how close \\nthey are to the place where the lewisite was released. Lewisite gas is heavier than air, so it \\nwill settle in lower areas. Lewisite is a liquid under a wide range of environmental \\nconditions, from below freezing to very hot temperatures. Therefore, it could last for a long \\ntime in the environment. If lewisite gas is released into the air, people may be exposed \\nthrough skin contact or eye contact. They may also be exposed by breathing air that \\ncontains lewisite. If lewisite liquid comes into contact with food, people may be exposed by \\neating the contaminated food. People may be exposed by drinking water that contains \\nlewisite or by getting the water on their bodies. Get fresh air by leaving the area where the \\nlewisite is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death \\nfrom lewisite. If lewisite was released outside, move away from the area. Go to the highest \\nground possible, because lewisite is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas. If lewisite \\nwas released indoors, get out of the building. Remove the clothing with liquid lewisite as \\nquickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping \\nothers, do not touch unsafe areas and take off the clothes quickly. As quickly as possible, \\nwash any liquid lewisite from your skin with lots of soap water. Washing with soap and \\nwater will protect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your \\nvision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear \\ncontacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in \\nyour eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with \\nsoap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. If possible, put \\nthe clothing in a plastic bag. Then put the first plastic bag in a second plastic bag. Throwing \\naway your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be \\non your clothes. If you placed your clothes in plastic bags, tell the local or state health \\ndepartment or emergency personnel when they arrive. Do not handle the plastic bags. \\nTreatment involves removing lewisite from the body as soon as possible and providing \\nsupportive medical care in a hospital. An antidote (cure for poisons) for lewisite is available \\nand is most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure. Breathing in large amounts of \\nlewisite gas may cause long-term respiratory (breathing) disease. If the eye is exposed for a \\nlong time, it may cause permanent blindness. Lewisite is not known to affect the immune \\nsystem. Severe skin burning is also less likely.

Body lice \\ncan spread disease. They live and lay eggs on clothing and bedding used by infested people. \\nAdult body lice are small, only 2.3 ? 3.6 mm in length (about the size of a sesame seed). \\nImproved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only treatment \\nneeded for body lice infestations; however, in some cases peduculicides are recommended. \\nBody lice can spread disease (epidemic typhus,Bartonella quintana infection, andepidemic \\nrelapsing fever). Intense itching (pruritus) and rash caused by an allergic reaction to louse \\nbites are common symptoms of body lice infestation. As with other lice infestations, intense \\nitching leads to scratching which can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection of the \\nskin. When body lice infestation lasts long, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become \\nthickened and darkened, particularly in the mid-section of the body (waist, groin, upper \\nthighs). Body lice exist worldwide but usually affect people who live in crowded conditions. \\nThey affect people without access to regular bathing and clean clothes. They can spread \\nquickly in: Body lice spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice. They \\ncan also spread through contact with clothing, beds, or linens that have been in contact with \\na person infested with lice. However, in the United States, actual infestation with body lice \\ntends to occur only in people who do not have access to housing, regular bathing, or clean \\nclothes. Nits (lice eggs) take 6 ? 9 days to hatch. Nits are tiny (0.8 ? 0.3 mm) and hard to see; \\nthey can be confused for dandruff. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) are about the size of a \\npinhead and take about a week to grow into adults. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame \\nseed, have six legs, and are tan to grayish white. Adult females can lay up to eight nits per \\nday. Adult lice need to feed on blood several times each day; without blood meals, the louse \\nwill die within 1 ? 2 days off the host. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice. \\nTake these steps to help prevent and control the spread of body lice: You can diagnose body \\nlice infestation by finding eggs and crawling lice in the seams of clothing.

You can find them mostly on your head, but also on your eyebrows and \\neyelashes. Adult head lice are roughly 2 ? 3 mm long (about the size of a sesame seed). Both \\nover-the-counter and prescription medications are available to treat head lice in your hair \\n(infestation). People with head lice may not have symptoms, particularly with a first \\ninfestation or when an infestation is light. Itching (pruritus) is the most common symptom \\nof head lice infestation. It is caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites. It may take four to \\nsix weeks for itching to appear the first time a person has head lice. Other symptoms may \\ninclude the following: Head lice do not transmit any disease and therefore are not \\nconsidered a health hazard. In the United States, infestation with head lice is most common \\namong preschool- and elementary school-age children and their household members and \\ncaretakers. There is not reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the \\nUnited States; however, an estimated 6 ? 12 million infestations occur each year in the \\nUnited States among children 3 ? 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that girls get head \\nlice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact. In the \\nUnited States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African American \\npersons than among persons of other races. The head louse found most frequently in the \\nUnited States may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of \\nsome types of hair, but not others. Head lice mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of \\na person infested with lice. Head lice move by crawling; they cannot hop or fly. Adult lice \\ncan live on a person's head for about 30 days. However, they will die within two days if they \\nfall off a person and cannot feed. Adult female head lice are usually larger than males and \\ncan lay about six eggs each day. Nits (lice eggs) cannot hatch and usually die within a week if \\nthey are not kept at the same temperature as those found close to the scalp. Nits take about \\na week (range 6 ? 9 days) to hatch into nymphs (young lice). Nymphs look similar to adult \\nlice but are very small (size of a pinhead); they take about seven days to mature into adult \\nlice. The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who \\nalready has head lice. This contact can be common among children playing at places like \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 496, 'page_label': '579'}, page_content='school or the home.

Especially if the wig or hairpiece hasn\\'t been worn in the \\npast 48 hours by a person with head lice. Head lice can survive under water for several \\nhours but are unlikely to spread in a swimming pool. Chlorine levels in pool water do not \\nkill head lice. Animals do not get or spread head lice. Take these steps to help prevent and \\ncontrol the spread of head lice: To help control a head lice outbreak in a community, school, \\nor camp, teach children to avoid activities that may spread head lice. For example, teach \\nchildren to Misdiagnosis of head lice infestation is common. Finding a live nymph (baby \\nlouse) or adult louse on the scalp or hair is the best way to diagnose a head lice infestation. \\nBecause adult and nymph lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they may be \\ndifficult to find. A fine-toothed louse comb may help you find lice. If you do not see crawling \\nlice, look for nits attached firmly within ¼ inch of the base of hair shafts. You will often see \\nnits on hair behind the ears and near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than \\n¼ inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always hatched or dead. Although head lice \\nand nits can be visible with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice \\nor nits. Nits are often confused with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair \\nspray droplets, and dirt particles. If you do not see nymphs or adults, and the only nits \\nfound are more than ¼ inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and does not \\nneed treatment.

They are \\nshort and crab-like and look very different from head and body lice. Pubic lice typically \\nattach to hair in the pubic area. Adult pubic lice are 1.1?1.8 mm in length (size of a pencil \\ntip). Either over-the-counter or prescription medications can treat pubic lice infestations. \\nInfestation or infested person means that a person has lice. Signs and symptoms of pubic \\nlice include: Pubic lice do not transmit disease. However, you could get sores and a bacterial \\ninfection from intense scratching. Anyone can get pubic lice. Pubic lice usually spread \\nthrough sexual contact and are most common in adults. You usually get pubic lice from \\nintimate, person-to-person contact, usually sexual contact. Occasionally pubic lice can \\nspread by clothing, bedding, or (very rarely) using a toilet seat that was just used by a \\nperson infested with public lice. Adult pubic lice are found only on humans and require \\nblood to survive. They will die within 24 ? 48 hours without a blood meal. Female adult \\npubic lice lay about 30 eggs during their 3 ? 4-week life span. Eggs hatch after about a week. \\nNymphs (newly hatched lice) mature into adults over 6 to 9 days. Animals do not get or \\nspread pubic lice. Pubic lice found on the head or eyelashes of children may be an indication \\nof sexual exposure or abuse. The following are steps that can help prevent and control the \\nspread of pubic (\"crab\") lice: Pubic lice infestation is diagnosed by finding a \"crab\" louse or '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 497, 'page_label': '580'}, page_content=\"nits on hair in the pubic region or, less commonly, elsewhere on the body.

Scientists are still learning about LUHF, and do not know which rodent \\nspecies spreads the virus. Most knowledge of LUHF comes from the only outbreak, which \\noccurred in 2008. The outbreak began in Zambia when a person became sick after exposure \\nto an infected rodent. This first patient sought care in a South African healthcare facility. \\nThere, four healthcare workers caring for the patient also became infected. Four out of the \\nfive cases were fatal. The symptoms of LUHF resemble those of severeLassa fever. LUHF \\nstarts with fever accompanied by headache and muscle pain. The disease increases in \\nseverity, with: Bleeding is not a typical symptom of LUHF. In fatal cases, a brief \\nimprovement was followed by rapid deterioration, trouble breathing, and problems with \\nthe heart and brain/nerves. Death occurred 10 to 13 days after symptoms began. People \\nwith LUHF start experiencing symptoms about 7 to 13 days after they were exposed to the \\nvirus. People who work in fields in southern Africa are at greatest risk for LUHF. They are \\nmore likely to have contact with the rodent that spreads the virus. Sexual partners of these \\nfield workers may also be at greater risk.

Healthcare providers should use different PPE depending \\non the state of the patient: Researchers studying Lujo virus must work only in Biosafety \\nLevel 4 (BSL-4) laboratories, which have stringent safety and security conditions. In the \\nUnited States, Lujo virus is classified as a Select Agent. If a healthcare worker suspects \\nLUHF, they can perform laboratory tests to diagnose the disease. Healthcare providers can \\ndiagnose LUHF with blood tests that detect the Lujo virus. They can also do antibody tests \\nto tell if someone had the virus in the past. However, these tests should only be done in a \\nhigh containment laboratory with good laboratory practices. Clinicians should notify their \\nhealth department if a patient has recently been in an area with LUHF and has compatible \\nsymptoms. There is no cure for LUHF. Patients should receive supportive care, including \\nrest, hydration, and treatment of symptoms. The drug Ribavirin may hold promise in the \\ntreatment of LUHF.

Lymphedema is swelling due to build-up of lymph fluid in the body. Lymph \\nnodes act like a drain in your sink. If the drain is clogged, the fluid cannot drain. It usually \\nhappens in the arms or legs, but can occur in other parts of the body. Lymph fluid is part of \\nthe lymph system that carries fluid and cells that help fight infections throughout the body. \\nSometimes this swelling develops quickly, or it may develop slowly over several months. \\nLymphedema can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment. Actor and cancer survivor \\nKathy Bates talks about lymphedema inthis video. Before you have surgery or radiation \\ntreatment for cancer, ask your doctor what can be done to lower the chances that you will \\nget lymphedema. The symptoms of lymphedema may include: If you notice any swelling \\nafter cancer treatment, talk to your doctor about what is causing it and how best to treat it. \\nIt is very important to see a doctor right away to find out why you have swelling. You should \\nmake sure there is no other cause of the swelling that needs immediate treatment, like a \\nblood clot. First, your doctor will examine you and ask you when you first noticed the \\nproblem. If your arm or leg is swollen, your doctor may measure it to compare it with your \\nother arm or leg. Usually, if your swollen arm or leg is 2 cm (about 4/5 of an inch) bigger \\nthan your other arm or leg, you have lymphedema. Your doctor may also suggest other tests \\nto find out if you have lymphedema and if so, what is causing it. Lymphoscintigraphy is a \\ntest that uses radioactive material to see if the lymph vessels are blocked. Other x-ray tests \\nmay be done to see what is causing the swelling. Computed tomography (CT) scans can take \\npictures of the swollen area to find out why the lymph vessels are blocked. At this time, \\nthere is no cure for lymphedema. The goal of treatment is to reduce the swelling or keep it \\nfrom getting worse, and to relieve symptoms. Your doctor can help you figure out which \\ntreatments are best for you.

Machines are \\nessential to many work tasks. They have built-in capabilities like motion, force, high \\ntemperature, and other energy sources, which contribute to its potential for causing harm. \\nMachine safety begins with understanding the nature of the machine's operation. Some \\nmachines are designed to execute unchanging tasks, while others might operate \\ncontinuously until completion. Additionally, certain machines function automatically, while \\nothers perform various functions on command. Understanding the specific characteristics \\nand modes of operation of each machine is fundamental to machine safety. The occupational \\nsafety and health industry define injury types by how they happen. A contact injury is an \\ninjury caused by contact with another device, machine or surface. Most machine injuries are \\ncontact injuries. A machine may cause a contact injury if it is on or off. There are different \\nkinds of contact injuries, including: Safeguards are protections or actions taken to guard, \\nprotect, prevent, or lessen the severity of an injury. Not all safeguards offer complete \\nprotection by themselves. How a safeguard interacts with the worker and process as a \\nwhole determines an effective safeguard. Controlling exposures to hazards in the workplace \\nis vital to protecting workers. The hierarchy of controls is a way of determining which \\nactions will best control exposures.

BSE caused a major outbreak in the 1980-90s, with cases \\nreported in at least 24 countries. Most cases occurred in the United Kingdom, but many \\nother countries also reported cases. Changes to feed policies have made BSE extremely rare \\nnow. However, animal health officials continue to monitor suspicious deaths in cows to \\nwatch for a potential BSE recurrence. BSE is caused by a prion, an infectious protein. Prions \\nare misfolded forms of proteins normally found in the bodies of animals and people. It \\ntypically takes years for symptoms to begin after an animal is infected with a prion. \\nScientists believe BSE may have been caused by feeding cattle meat-and-bone meal that \\ncontained prion-infected products from cows or sheep. There is strong evidence the BSE \\noutbreak grew and spread throughout the U.K. when such infected feed was given to young \\ncalves. The first two cases of BSE were identified in cows in 1986 in the United Kingdom. \\nThe cows were likely infected in the 1970s. The U.K. quickly became the epicenter of the \\noutbreak. Overall, more than 184,000 cows in the U.K. died from BSE between 1986 and \\n2015. The outbreak was widespread, with more than 35,000 U.K. herds affected. Cases \\npeaked in 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week. Cases deceased drastically after control \\nmeasures were implemented. BSE cases are still reported occasionally but are very rare. \\nOutside the U.K., BSE was first reported in Ireland in 1989 and Portugal and Switzerland in \\n1990. By 2005, the number of countries reporting BSE among native cattle increased to 24, \\nwith the majority in Europe. The first North American BSE case was reported in 1993 in a \\ncow imported into Canada from the UK. Rendered cohorts of this cow may have been \\nresponsible for 19 additional Canadian BSE cases beginning in 2003. In addition, animal \\nhealth officials have identified 6 BSE cases in cows in the United States. One was imported '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 509, 'page_label': '592'}, page_content=\"from Canada and is believed to have been infected there. The others were diagnosed with \\natypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by \\ncontaminated feed. Animal health officials eventually determined BSE-infected cows had \\neaten feed made from other cows that died from prion disease. This led to feed bans in \\nmultiple countries, which drastically reduced the number of BSE cases reported. Early \\nefforts to control the BSE outbreak focused on culling (killing) sick animals to prevent them \\nfrom entering the food chain. The UK implemented the most stringent control measure - \\nexcluding animals >30 months old from the human and animal food supplies. It also \\nincluded a ban on using meat from around the animals' spinal columns since prions affect \\nthe nervous system. The programs - along with bans in other countries - have prevented \\nadditional BSE outbreaks. Occasional cases still occur, but they are very rare. Strong \\nevidence exists that consuming meat from BSE-infected cows causesvariant Creutzfeldt-\\nJakob disease (vCJD)in people. vCJD cases began in the U.K. about 10 years after BSE-\\ncontaminated beef likely made its way for an extended period into food produced for \\npeople. This is consistent with the time between when someone is exposed to a prion \\ndisease and when they develop one themselves. As BSE has been largely eradicated, it is not \\nthought to pose much risk to people currently.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. \\nOnce they infect a person, they can cause diseases that attack different parts of the body. \\nSymptoms of filarial worm infections range from itching and swelling to disfigurement and \\nblindness. However, many people infected with filarial worms will have no symptoms. \\nDiseases and common symptoms caused by filarial worms include Filarial worm diseases \\naffect millions of people a year in Africa, South America, the Pacific islands, and Asia. They \\nspread mostly through the bites of insects like blackflies, mosquitoes, or midges. Tiny \\nimmature worms, known as larvae, will enter a human body when the insect bites into the \\nskin. Once inside a person, they spread throughout the body, grow, and reproduce. When an \\ninsect bites an infected person, the insect can ingest the new larvae and eventually infect \\nanother person. In most cases, the best way to prevent most filarial worm infections is \\ntoavoid insect bites. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, using insect repellent on \\nexposed skin, and sleeping under mosquito nets will help prevent insects from biting you. \\nMedications known as antiparasitic drugs can treat new filarial worm infections. In people \\nwith advanced disease-causing chronic swelling, surgery or lymphedema care may be \\nneeded. Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are currently the target of mass drug \\nadministration (MDA) campaigns. These campaigns deliver safe and inexpensive drugs \\naimed at reducing or eliminating transmission of these infections. For some, filaria MDA will \\nreduce symptoms as well. For others, other treatments are needed for symptoms.

Measlescauses fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. \\nComplications can include ear infection, diarrhea, pneumonia, brain damage, and death. \\nMumpscauses fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen \\nsalivary glands. Complications can include swelling of the testicles or ovaries, deafness, \\ninflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord \\n(encephalitis/meningitis) and, rarely, death. Rubella, causes fever, sore throat, rash, \\nheadache, and red, itchy eyes. If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have \\na miscarriage, or her baby could be born with serious birth defects. Due to high vaccination \\nrates, outbreaks of measles, mumps, and rubella in the U.S. are not as common as they were \\nbefore the vaccine began being used. However, these diseases still appear in the U.S. and \\npeople who decide not to vaccinate their children because of religious or personal beliefs \\nput their children and others at risk for getting these diseases. Themeasles, mumps, rubella, \\nand varicella (MMRV)vaccine also protects against these diseases. Some people may \\nexperience swelling in the cheeks or neck. MMR vaccine rarely causes a temporary low \\nplatelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder that usually goes away without \\ntreatment and is not life threatening. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most \\npeople who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Getting MMR \\nvaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella. MMR vaccine has been \\nlinked with a very small risk offebrile seizures. Febrile seizures following MMR vaccination \\nare rare and are not associated with any long-term effects. Because the risk of febrile \\nseizures increases as infants get older, it is recommended that they get vaccinated as soon \\nas recommended. Extremely rarely, a person may have a serious allergic reaction to MMR \\nvaccine. Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic \\nneomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine. No \\npublished scientific evidence shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine \\nintothree individual shots. Measles outbreaks can occur in communities with a high number \\nof unvaccinated people. Maintaining high overall MMR vaccination rates is needed to \\ncontinue to limit the spread of measles. Because signs of autism may appear around the \\nsame time children receive the MMR vaccine, some parents may worry that the vaccine \\ncauses autism. Vaccine safety experts, including experts at CDC and the American Academy \\nof Pediatrics (AAP), agree that MMR vaccine is not responsible for recent increases in the \\nnumber of children with autism. In 2004, a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) \\nconcluded that there is no link between autism and MMR vaccine, and that there is no link \\nbetween autism and vaccines that contain thimerosal as a preservative. CDC and the Food \\nand Drug Administration (FDA) are committed to ensuring that vaccines provided to the \\npublic are safe and effective. Once vaccines are licensed or authorized for emergency use in \\nthe United States, CDC and FDA continuously monitor them through several safety systems.

Cases may increase after hurricanes, \\nheavy rain, and other severe weather events because the bacteria rise to the surface of the \\nsoil. People can get melioidosis by: It's very rare for people to get the disease from another \\nperson. Many kinds of animals can get melioidosis, including: B. pseudomalleiis mostly \\nfound in tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, where it \\ncauses widespread melioidosis. In the United States,B. pseudomalleioccurs in Puerto Rico, \\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Gulf Coast area of the state of Mississippi. Most melioidosis \\nillnesses in the United States occur in people who have traveled to areas where the disease \\nis more common. Some cases have also occurred in people who have had contact with \\ncontaminated products made overseas. Melioidosis has a wide range of signs and \\nsymptoms. You usually develop symptoms of melioidosis within 1 to 4 weeks after you've \\nbeen exposed to it. Some cases have developed symptoms months or years after exposure. \\nThe disease can affect one body system or affect the entire body. Because of these factors, \\nmelioidosis is hard to diagnose and may be mistaken for other diseases. Sometimes the \\nillness is just in one area (localized), and it may look like an ulcer or skin sore. You might \\nhave a fever, swelling, and muscle aches. Most often, melioidosis shows up as a lung \\ninfection. You might have a cough, chest pain, high fever, headache, and you might not feel \\nlike eating. Whether you've just come down with melioidosis or you've had it for a long \\ntime, it can affect different organ systems throughout the body (disseminated infection). It \\ncan cause problems with the liver, spleen, prostate, joints, bones, lymph nodes, skin, or \\nbrain. Melioidosis can lead to a dangerous bloodstream infection (sepsis). Symptoms of \\ndisseminated infection include: Although healthy people may get melioidosis, having the \\nfollowing medical conditions may increase your risk: Certain activities also may increase \\nyour risk of being exposed to the bacteria that causes melioidosis, including: In areas where \\nthe disease is widespread, contact with contaminated soil or water can put people at risk for \\nmelioidosis. To help lower the risk of exposure: If you are diagnosed with melioidosis, \\ndoctors will decide how long you'll need treatment based on how bad the infection is. \\nTreatment generally includes: It's important to complete your treatment so that the \\ninfection goes away completely. One reason public health authorities study the disease is \\nbecause the bacteria that cause melioidosis might be used as a weapon in a biological attack. \\nA biological attack is the intentional release of pathogens (germs) that can sicken or kill \\npeople, livestock, or crops.

Two types of mercury to which people may be exposed ? \\nmethylmercury and ethylmercury ? are very different. Methylmercury is the type of \\nmercury found in certain kinds of fish. At high exposure levels methylmercury can be toxic \\nto people. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible \\nout of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some \\nmethylmercury. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body \\nmore quickly than methylmercury, and is therefore less likely to cause any harm. \\nThimerosal is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose (multi-dose vials) \\nto prevent growth of germs, like bacteria and fungi. Introduction of bacteria and fungi has \\nthe potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for \\nadministration. Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, \\nserious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added \\nduring the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth. Thimerosal was taken out of \\nchildhood vaccines in the United States in 2001. For a complete list of vaccines and their \\nthimerosal content level, see the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Thimerosal in \\nVaccinespage. Thimerosal use in medical products has a record of being very safe. Data from \\nmany studies show no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in \\nvaccines.123456 The most common side-effects of thimerosal in vaccines are minor \\nreactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. Although rare, some people may be \\nallergic to thimerosal. Research does not show any link between thimerosal in vaccines \\nandautism, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Many well conducted studies have concluded \\nthat thimerosal in vaccines does not contribute to the development of autism.135Even after \\nthimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to \\nincrease, which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism. A \\n2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown that \\nprenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal does \\nnot increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).1 Studies have assessed the possible \\nassociation between ethyl mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing vaccines and \\nneuropsychological functioning including an objective measurement of neuropsychological \\nfunctioning.

Common problems \\ninclude: The causes of microcephaly in most babies are unknown.1Some known causes of \\nmicrocephaly are: Microcephaly can be diagnosed during pregnancy through ultrasound, or \\nafter the baby is born. Prenatal diagnosis of microcephaly can be done late in the second or \\nearly in the third trimester. To diagnose microcephaly after birth, a healthcare provider will \\nmeasure the head circumference of the baby. This is a measure of the distance around the \\nbaby's head. The provider then compares this measurement to population standards \\nusingCDC charts(based on age and sex) orINTERGROWTH 21st(based on age, sex, and \\npregnancy duration). Microcephaly is a head circumference that is significantly smaller than \\nthe average for babies of the same age and sex. Commonly used birth head circumference \\nreference charts are based on measurements taken before 24 hours of age. So, it is common \\nto measure a baby's head circumference in the first 24 hours. Head circumference \\nmeasurements may be influenced by factors related to delivery that might alter the shape of \\nthe baby's head. If the baby's head was affected by the delivery, a provider might wait \\nlonger than 24 hours. Widely accepted head circumference charts are theWHO chartsfor 0-2 \\nyears. If the healthcare provider suspects microcephaly, he or she can request tests to help \\nconfirm the diagnosis and look for other problems. For example, magnetic resonance \\nimaging can provide information on the structure of the baby's brain. Microcephaly is a \\nlifelong condition. There is no known cure or standard treatment for microcephaly. \\nMicrocephaly can range from mild to severe, and treatment options can range as well. \\nBabies with mild microcephaly often do not experience any additional problems. These \\nbabies will need regular check-ups to monitor their growth and development. For more \\nsevere cases, babies will need ongoing care and treatment focused on managing their health \\nproblems (mentioned above). Developmental services early in life often help babies with \\nmicrocephaly to improve and maximize their physical and intellectual abilities.

Septata intestinalis)] \\n[Tubulinosema acridophagus] [Enterocytozoon bieneusi] [Nosema spp.] [Pleistophora sp.] \\n[Trachipleistophora spp.] [Vittaforma corneae (syn. Nosema corneum)] The microsporidia \\nare a group of unicellular intracellular parasites closely related to fungi, although the nature \\nof the relation to the kingdom Fungi is not clear. The taxonomic position of this group has \\nbeen debated and revised repeatedly; historically, they were considered protozoa and often \\nremain managed by diagnostic parasitology laboratories. Microsporidia are characterized \\nby the production of resistant spores that vary in size (usually 1?4 µm for medically-\\nimportant species). They possess a unique organelle, the polar tubule or polar filament, \\nwhich is coiled inside the spore as demonstrated by its ultrastructure. Microsporidia also \\npossess degenerated mitochondria called mitosomes and lack a conventional Golgi \\napparatus. To date, more than 1400 species belonging to over 200 genera have been \\ndescribed as parasites infecting a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. There \\nare at least 15 microsporidian species that have been identified as human pathogens; the \\nvast majority of cases being caused byEnterocytozoon bieneusi,followed by \\nsomeEncephalitozoonspecies (E. cuniculi,E. hellem,E. intestinalis(=Septata intestinalis)). \\nOther less frequently reported agents include members of the generaAnncaliia(=Brachiola) \\n(A. algerae,A. connori, A. vesicularum),Microsporidium(M.ceylonensis,M. \\nafricanum),Trachipleistophora(T. hominis, T. anthropophthera),Nosema \\nocularum,Pleistophoraronneafiei,Vittaforma corneae(=Nosema corneae),Tubulinosema \\nacridophagus, and an unknown species likely belonging toEndoreticulatus. The infective \\nform of microsporidia is the resistant spore, which can persist in the environment for \\nmonthsThe spore then germinates, rapidly everting its polar tubule which contacts the \\neukaryotic host cell membrane. The spore then injects the infective sporoplasm into the \\nhost cell through the polar tubule. Inside the cell, the sporoplasm enters the proliferative \\nphase marked by extensive multiplication via merogony (binary fission or multiple fission), \\ncreating meronts. The location of this developmental stage within the host cell varies by \\ngenus; it can occur either in direct contact with the host cell cytosol (Enterocytozoon, \\nNosema), inside a parasitophorous vacuole of unknown origin (Encephalitozoon), in a \\nparasite-secreted envelope (Pleistophora, Trachipleistophora), or surrounded by the host \\ncell endoplasmic reticulum (Endoreticulatus, Vittaforma).  Following the proliferative \\nphase, meronts undergo sporogony in which the thick spore wall and invasion apparatus \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 530, 'page_label': '613'}, page_content='develop, creating sporonts and eventually mature spores when all organelles are polarized. \\nWhen the spores increase in number and completely fill the host cell cytoplasm, the cell \\nmembrane is disrupted and spores are released to the surroundings. These free mature \\nspores can infect new cells thus continuing the cycle. Mature spores of intestinal-localizing \\nspecies may be shed in feces, although the route of transmission remains uncertain for \\nmany species. Exposure to spores in water or in soil appears to be a potentially major route, \\nbased on the finding of spores in these sources along with case histories.E. bieneusiandV. \\ncorneaehave been identified in surface waters, and spores ofNosemasp. (and likelyA. \\nalgerae) have been identified in ditch water. Cases of donor-derived microsporidiosis \\n(Encephalitozoon cuniculi) following bone marrow, kidney, liver, and heart transplantation \\nhave been confirmed. Many domestic and wild animals may be naturally infected with \\nvarious medically-important microsporidia.Enterocytozoon bieneusiis generally considered \\na human parasite, but has been detected in swine, primates, cattle, cats, dogs, and several \\nother mammals. Some, but not all, of these animal-derived strains appear to represent \\nzoonotic genotypes. Encephalitozoon cuniculiis endemic in several captive and wild rabbit \\npopulations. It has also occasionally been found in domestic dogs, cats, foxes, captive \\nmonkeys, and mink. Birds, especially psittacines (parrots, parakeets, love birds, \\nbudgerigars, etc.), may represent reservoirs forEncephalitozoon hellem. Unlike the other \\ntwo important members of the genus,E. intestinalisis only rarely identified in animals other \\nthan humans. The host range of the other microsporidia known to infect humans is not as \\nwell known. No animal reservoir has been identified forVittaforma cornea.Pleistophoraspp. \\nare found in fish and reptiles, but spore morphology in these species is inconsistent with \\nthat of the species implicated in human infections (P. ronneafiei).Tubulinosema \\nacridophagus,Trachipleistophoraspp., andAnncaliia algeraeare related to known insect \\nparasites, however, the significance of insects in transmission is unclear. Microsporidia are \\nbeing increasingly recognized as opportunistic infectious agents worldwide. Efforts to \\ncharacterize the global distribution of species and genotypes are ongoing.  Human \\nmicrosporidiosis represents an important and rapidly emerging opportunistic disease. \\nHistorically it has been observed in severely immunocompromised persons, particularly \\namong persons with AIDS, however the implementation of effective anti-retroviral \\ntherapies has reduced the incidence in this group considerably. Cases are also known to \\noccur in immunocompetent individuals. The clinical manifestations of microsporidiosis are \\nvery diverse, varying according to the causal species and route of infection. Disseminated \\ninfection can be fatal. Of all of the manifestations of microsporidiosis,Enterocytozoon \\nbieneusi-associated diarrhea is the most common. Below is a table summarizing the typical \\nsites of infection for various species: Adapted from: Han, B. and Weiss, L.M., 2017. \\nMicrosporidia: obligate intracellular pathogens within the fungal kingdom.Microbiology \\nSpectrum, 5 (2).      Light microscopic examination of the stained clinical smears, especially \\nthe fecal samples, is an inexpensive method of diagnosing microsporidial infections even \\nthough it does not allow identification of microsporidia to the species level. The most widely \\nused staining technique is the Chromotrope 2R method or its modifications. This technique \\nstains the spore and the spore wall a bright pinkish red. Often, a darker-staining equatorial \\nband is seen in the middle of the spore. This technique, however, is lengthy and time '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 531, 'page_label': '614'}, page_content='consuming and requires about 90 min. A recently developed ?Quick-Hot Gram Chromotrope \\ntechnique? however, cuts down the staining time to less than 10 min and provides a good \\ndifferentiation from the lightly stained background fecal materials so that the spores stand \\nout for easy visualization.  The spores stain dark violet and the equatorial band is enhanced. \\nIn some cases dark staining Gram positive granules are also clearly seen.  Chemofluorescent \\nagents such as Calcofluor white are also useful in the quick identification of spores in fecal \\nsmears. The spores measure from 0.8 to 1.4 µm in the case ofEnterocytozoon bieneusi, and \\n1.5 to 4 µm inAnncaliia algerae,Encephalitozoonspp.,Vittaforma corneae, andNosemaspp. \\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) is still the gold standard and is necessary for the \\nidentification of the microsporidian species, which is based on internal features of the spore \\nsuch as the number of polar tubule coils. However, TEM is expensive, time consuming, and \\nnot feasible for routine diagnosis. IFAs are available for microsporidia using monoclonal \\nand/or polyclonal antibodies. The CDC offers molecular identification ofEnterocytozoon \\nbieneusi,Encephalitozoon intestinalis,Encephalitozoon hellemandEncephalitozoon \\ncuniculiusing species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Molecular \\nidentification of other microsporidia species can be attempted using genera-specific \\nprimers and sequencing analysis on a case-by-case basis.

The virus can spread from camels to people through direct physical contact. \\nLimited human-to-human transmission is possible. MERS has caused severe respiratory \\ndisease in most diagnosed cases, and many of those patients died. Typical symptoms \\ninclude fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Most MERS cases have been detected in \\ncountries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. However, a number of cases linked to travel \\nhave been detected in countries outside this region. Most people with confirmed MERS-CoV \\ninfection have had severe respiratory illness. MERS symptoms usually appear 5 or 6 days \\nafter a person is exposed. However, symptoms can appear as early as 2 days and up to 14 \\ndays after exposure. Common symptoms of MERS include: Some people may also have \\ndiarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. It is also possible that someone with MERS may have only \\nmild symptoms or no symptoms. In most known MERS cases, the infected person developed \\npneumonia. Additional complications such as kidney failure have also occurred. About 3 or \\n4 out of every 10 people reported with a MERS infection died. Most of the people who die \\nfrom MERS had at least one preexisting medical condition. Certain conditions may increase \\nthe risk of getting severe complications from MERS. These include: You may be at increased \\nrisk of getting MERS if you: The virus that causes MERS can spread through respiratory \\nsecretions, such as saliva or mucous, of infected animals or people. The MERS-CoV virus is \\nmostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to \\ntransmission to humans. People infected through contact with camels can then spread the \\nvirus to other people. Large MERS outbreaks from person-to-person spread have occurred \\nin healthcare facilities treating patients with MERS. Some spread can occur in households \\nthrough close contact (like sharing a bed or caring for someone who is sick). The largest \\nknown outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea \\nin 2015. Multiple healthcare facilities were affected by the outbreak, which was associated \\nwith a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. All reported person-to-person \\ntransmissions of MERS have been linked to a person who had been in or near the Arabian \\nPeninsula. Researchers continue to investigate clusters of MERS cases to better understand \\nhow the virus spreads. No vaccine exists to protect people against MERS. For travelers, the \\nWorld Health Organization recommends: No specific antiviral treatment is recommended \\nfor MERS. People with MERS often receive supportive medical care and care to help relieve \\nsymptoms.

However, these seizures are not \\ncommon and have not been associated with any long-term problems. Rarely, the MMRV \\nvaccine can cause swelling of neck or cheeks or a temporary low platelet count. Extremely \\nrarely, the vaccine's ingredients cause severe allergic (anaphylactic) reactions. Children \\nshould not get MMRV vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any \\ncomponent of the vaccine, including gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin.

Getting MMRV vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, rubella, \\nor varicella. Through use of CDC\\'sVaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)Project\\'srapid cycle analysis \\n(RCA), scientists can detect adverse events in near real time so that the public can be \\ninformed quickly of any possible risks. VSD uses computerized data from managed care \\norganizations, which gather data on vaccination, demographic information, and health \\noutcomes of their patients (more than 8.8 million patients across the country each year). As \\npart of ongoing efforts to monitor the safety of vaccines, CDC used rapid cycle analysis to \\nstudy the safety of the MMRV vaccine. Only children aged 12-23 months who received the \\nfirst dose were studied. This information was presented at the June 2009 Advisory \\nCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting. Because these studies showed an \\nincreased risk for fever after MMRV vaccination, compared with vaccination with MMR and \\nvaricella vaccines in separate shots at the same visit, there was concern about a potential \\nincreased risk for febrile seizures (seizures triggered by a rising or dropping fever) after \\nMMRV vaccination. As part of routine monitoring of vaccine safety for all new vaccines, CDC \\nconducted studies of the safety of MMRV vaccine. In these studies, CDC analyzed data \\nreported to theVSDregarding MMRV vaccine given to children aged 12-23 months, the age \\nwhen the first dose of MMRV or MMR and varicella vaccines is recommended. The study \\nassessed the rate of several medical events after MMRV vaccination, including febrile \\nseizures. Merck, the manufacturer of the MMRV vaccine, also sponsored an observational \\nstudy (after MMRV vaccine was licensed) of febrile seizures after the first dose of MMRV \\nvaccine was given to children aged 12-23 months. Here are some key findings from that \\nstudy: These findings and other relevant data were presented to theAdvisory Committee on \\nImmunization Practices (ACIP). In May 2010, CDC releasednew recommendationson the use \\nof MMRV vaccine. To help parents and healthcare providers better understand the ACIP \\nrecommendations, risks and benefits of MMRV vaccine, and febrile seizures, the following \\ninformation is available: The study, \"Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella Combination \\nVaccine and the Risk of Febrile Seizures\" uses computerized information from CDC\\'sVaccine \\nSafety Datalink (VSD) Project. VSD consists of managed care organizations which gather \\nvaccination and demographic information, as well as health outcomes of their patients \\n(more than 9.2 million across the U.S.) Researchers examined VSD data on more than \\n83,000 children who received their first dose of MMRV vaccine and over 376,000 children \\nwho received their first doses of MMR and varicella vaccines given at the same visit from \\nthe year 2000 to the year 2008. CDC recommends providers who choose to use the \\ncombination MMRV vaccine be aware of and clearly communicate to parents and caregivers \\nthe increased risk of fever and seizure within the 7 to 10 days following vaccination. Parents \\nshould be educated on the risk of seizure following the combination MMRV vaccine and \\nknow their options. Most children recover quickly from febrile seizures and have no lasting \\neffects. CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are committed to ensuring that \\nvaccines provided to the public are safe and effective. Once vaccines are licensed or \\nauthorized for emergency use in the United States, CDC and FDA continuously monitor them \\nthrough several safety systems. Information about vaccine side effects, answers to common \\nvaccine safety questions, and specific information for healthcare professionals and parents. \\nLanguages Language Assistance '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 537, 'page_label': '620'}, page_content=\" \\n-------------------------------------------------- \\nDisease: Mobile \\nURL: https://www.cdc.gov/digital-social-media-tools/mobile/index.html \\nDisease Information: Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official \\ngovernment organization in the United States.

Molds have been \\non the Earth for millions of years. Mold can get in your home through open doors, windows, \\nvents, and heating and air conditioning systems. Mold in the air outside can be brought \\nindoors on clothing, shoes, bags, and even pets. Mold will grow where there is moisture, \\nsuch as around leaks in roofs, windows, or pipes, or where there has been a flood. Mold \\ngrows on paper, cardboard, ceiling tiles, and wood. Mold can also grow in dust, paints, \\nwallpaper, insulation, drywall, carpet, fabric, and upholstery. Mold is found both indoors \\nand outdoors. Mold can enter your home through open doorways, windows, vents, and \\nheating and air conditioning systems. Mold in the air outside can also attach itself to \\nclothing, shoes, and pets can and be carried indoors. When mold spores drop on places with \\nexcessive moisture, such as where leakage may have occurred in roofs, pipes, walls, plant \\npots, or where there has been flooding, they will grow. Exposure to damp and moldy \\nenvironments may cause a variety of health effects, or none at all. For some people, mold \\ncan cause a stuffy nose, sore throat, coughing or wheezing, burning eyes, or skin rash. \\nPeople withasthmaor who are allergic to mold may have severe reactions. Immune-\\ncompromised people and people with chronic lung disease may get infections in their lungs \\nfrom mold. For people who are sensitive to molds exposure to molds can lead to symptoms \\nsuch as stuffy nose, wheezing, and red or itchy eyes, or skin. Severe reactions, such as fever \\nor shortness of breath, may occur among workers exposed to large amounts of molds in \\noccupational settings, such as farmers working around moldy hay. In 2004 the Institute of \\nMedicine (IOM) found there was sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure to mold with \\nupper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, and wheeze in otherwise healthy people; with '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 542, 'page_label': '625'}, page_content=\"asthma symptoms in people with asthma; and with hypersensitivity pneumonitis in \\nindividuals susceptible to that immune-mediated condition. In 2009, the World Health \\nOrganization issued additional guidance, the WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: \\nDampness and Mould.  Other recent studies have suggested a potential link of early mold \\nexposure to development of asthma in some children, particularly among children who may \\nbe genetically susceptible to asthma development, and that selected interventions that \\nimprove housing conditions can reduce morbidity from asthma and respiratory allergies. \\nThere are steps you can take to prevent mold growth in your home. If you see or smell mold, \\nyou should remove it. You do not need to know the type of mold. If mold is growing in your \\nhome, you need to clean up the moldandfix the moisture problem. Mold can be removed \\nfrom hard surfaces with household products, soap and water, or a bleach solution ofno \\nmore than1 cupof household laundry bleachin 1 gallon of water. (Also available in Spanish \\nand Vietnamese) CDC does not recommend mold testing. The health effects of mold are \\ndifferent for different people so you cannot rely on sampling and culturing to know whether \\nsomeone might become sick. No matter what type of mold is present, you need to remove it. \\nAlso, good sampling for mold can be expensive, and there are no set standards for what is \\nand what is not an acceptable quantity of different kinds of mold in a home. The best thing \\nyou can do is to safely remove the mold and prevent future mold growth. Mold can cause \\nmany health effects.

However, it can lead to severe \\nbrain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately. People typically get infected \\nwith B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey; or have contact \\nwith the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth. Symptoms typically start within one month of \\nbeing exposed to B virus. However, they could appear in as little as 3 to 7 days. The first \\nindications of B virus infection are typically flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills. Then, \\nyou may develop small blisters in the wound or area on your body that had contact with the \\nmonkey. As the disease progresses, the virus spreads to and causes inflammation (swelling) \\nof the brain and spinal cord. Problems with breathing and death can occur one day to three \\nweeks after symptoms appear. Most people will not come in contact with monkeys, so their \\nrisk of getting infected with B virus is very low. However, laboratory workers, veterinarians, \\nand people more likely exposed to macaque monkeys have a higher risk of getting B virus \\ninfection. B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people. You can get \\ninfected with B virus if you: There are no vaccines that can protect you against B virus \\ninfection. If you are in a place with macaque monkeys, stay away from them so that you \\ndon't get bitten or scratched. You should not touch or feed monkeys. People at increased \\nriskshould follow appropriate laboratory and animal facility protocols to reduce the spread \\nof B virus. If your healthcare provider determines that you need treatment for B virus \\nexposure or infection, you may be given antiviral medications. Timely first aid and \\ntreatment for high-risk exposures is crucial to preventing life-threatening disease. Macaque \\nmonkeys housed in primate facilities usually become infected with B virus by the time they \\nreach adulthood. However, even when they are infected with B virus, monkeys typically do \\nnot have symptoms, or have just mild disease. B virus can spread from infected macaque \\nmonkeys to people.

Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by \\ndifferent respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed \\nschool and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three \\ncolds, and children often have more. The signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within \\n2 to 3 days of infection and can include: Complications from infection with respiratory \\nviruses can include: Some respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have \\nserious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups \\natincreased risk for severe illness. This includes infants, older adults, or those with \\nunderlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems. More than 200 respiratory \\nviruses can cause colds.Rhinovirusesare the most frequent cause of colds in the United \\nStates. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common \\nhuman coronaviruses,parainfluenza viruses,adenoviruses,enteroviruses(includingEV-D68), \\nandhuman metapneumovirus. SARS-CoV-2(the virus that causes COVID-19),influenza \\nvirus(the virus that causes flu), andrespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)can also cause cold-like \\nsymptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe \\nillness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu,get tested, \\nespecially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for \\nCOVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin. Different \\nrespiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through \\ndroplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can \\nenter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch \\nyour eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, \\nsuch as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. \\nYou can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, \\nusually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms \\ncirculate during spring, summer, or fall.

Mumps is still a common disease in many countries, so it's important to get \\nvaccinated to protect yourself. Most people with mumps recover completely within 2 \\nweeks. People who are infected with mumps don?t get sick right away. It can take 2 to 4 \\nweeks for them to show signs of infection. Common signs of mumps are puffy cheeks and a \\ntender,swollen jaw. This is caused by the swollen salivary glands under one or both ears. \\nEarly symptoms can begin a few days before the swelling. The most serious complication is \\nbrain inflammation of the brain. Some people who have been vaccinated against mumps can \\nstill get the disease. However, they usually have milder symptoms and complications are \\nless frequent. Anyone who is not protected against mumps is at risk of getting the disease. \\nSome groups of people have a higher likelihood of spreading disease because they are \\nconstantly in close contact with each other. These include school-aged children, students at \\npost-high school educational institutions, and healthcare personnel. People traveling \\ninternationally to areas where mumps is still common, or people near outbreaks, are also \\nmore likely to get mumps. Mumps is a contagious disease caused by the mumps virus. It \\nspreads through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from the mouth, nose, or \\nthroat. You can get mumps and spread the virus by: A person infected with mumps can \\nspread it: Protect yourself with the vaccine. Getting two doses of the mumps vaccine is the \\nbest protection against mumps. It's usually given as a combination vaccine called measles, \\nmumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which protects against all three diseases. Your child?s \\ndoctor may also offer the MMRV vaccine, a combination vaccine that protects against \\nmeasles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox).

Usually, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately. It \\nmay take up to 24 hours for some symptoms to occur. Sulfur mustard can have different \\neffects on specific parts of the body. Circulatory (heart and blood) signs and symptoms \\ninclude decreased formation of blood cells and platelets. This can lead to weakness, \\nbleeding, and infections. Digestive signs and symptoms include: Eye signs and symptoms \\ninclude: Respiratory (breathing) signs and symptoms include: Skin signs and symptoms \\ninclude: Other signs and symptoms include: Sulfur mustard can last 1 to 2 days in the \\nenvironment in average weather conditions. Sulfur mustard can last weeks to months in \\nvery cold conditions. Follow any directions by local authorities. If sulfur mustard is in the \\nair, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing it in. Because \\nsulfur mustard gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase chances of \\nexposure there. Do not stay in lower areas. If clothing touched sulfur mustard, people can be \\nexposed by touching or breathing in sulfur mustard gas from the clothing. Eating, drinking, \\nor touching food or drink with sulfur mustard can expose people to sulfur mustard. Do not \\nuse or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have touched \\nsulfur mustard if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken \\nand sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected. Wash the outside of the \\ncontainer before using. If sulfur mustard is in water, people can be exposed by touching or \\ndrinking the water.  \\nPeople can also be exposed by swallowing liquid sulfur mustard, getting it on their skin, or \\ngetting it in their eyes. Get away from the area where the sulfur mustard was released and \\nbreathe fresh air. If the sulfur mustard release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in \\nplace.

It causes \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 554, 'page_label': '637'}, page_content=\"severe fatigue not improved by rest, problems thinking and sleeping, dizziness, pain,  and \\nmany other symptoms. People with ME/CFS may not look sick but can't do their normal \\nactivities. ME/CFS may get worse after they do any activity -- physical or mental. This \\nsymptom is called post-exertional malaise (PEM). After they exert themselves, they may \\nneed to stay in bed for an extended time. About 1 in 4 people with ME/CFS are confined to \\nbed at some point in their illness. It is difficult to diagnose because there is no specific test \\nfor ME/CFS. One reason that people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed may be limited \\naccess to healthcare. Another reason may be a lack of healthcare providers who know about \\nME/CFS and how to recognize it. Anyone can get ME/CFS. It doesn't matter what age, \\ngender or ethnicity they are. However, some groups are more affected than others. People \\nwith ME/CFS are not able to function the same way they did before they became ill. They \\nmay not always be able to do daily tasks like showering or cooking a meal. ME/CFS often \\nmakes it hard to keep a job, go to school, and take part in family and social life. ME/CFS can \\nlast for years and sometimes leads to serious disability. ME/CFS is most common in people \\nin middle age but also affects kids, teens and elderly people. Among adults, women are \\naffected more often than men. Among children, teens are more affected than younger kids. \\nPeople who are white are diagnosed more often than other races and ethnicities. But many \\npeople with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, especially among people from racial and \\nethnic minority groups. Symptoms of ME/CFS may appear similar to many other illnesses. \\nThere is no test to confirm ME/CFS. This makes it difficult to diagnose. The illness can also \\nbe unpredictable. Symptoms may come and go, or there may be changes in how severe \\nsymptoms are over time. A doctor should be able to distinguish ME/CFS from other \\nillnesses by doing a thorough medical exam. This includes asking many questions about the \\npatient's health history and current illness. They should also ask about how often symptoms \\noccur, how bad they are, and how long they have lasted. It is also important for doctors to \\ntalk with patients about how the symptoms affect their lives. There is no cure or approved \\ntreatment for ME/CFS. But some symptoms can be treated or managed. Treating these \\nsymptoms might provide relief for some people with ME/CFS but not others. Other \\nstrategies, like learning new ways to manage activity, can also help. People with ME/CFS, \\ntheir families, and healthcare providers need to work together to decide which symptom \\ncauses the most problems. This should be treated first after discussing possible benefits and \\nharms of any treatment plans, including medicines and other therapies. Healthcare \\nproviders need to support their patients' families as they come to understand how to live \\nwith this illness. Providers and families should remember that this process is likely to be \\nhard on people with ME/CFS. ME/CFS is a serious, debilitating illness that makes it hard for \\npeople to do activities they could previously do without difficulty.

Mycetoma causes painless \\nmasses underneath the skin. Most cases occur in equatorial regions of Africa, Latin America, \\nand Asia known as the ?mycetoma belt.\"  It is more common among men than women and \\nfarmwork increases risk. Diagnosis is made by laboratory testing of samples taken from the \\ninfected area.  Mycetoma is treated with antibiotics or antifungals, depending on whether \\nthe infection is caused by bacteria or fungi.  Surgery is sometimes needed to cut away the \\ninfected tissue. Wearing shoes might help prevent mycetoma. Mycetoma can be caused by \\nbacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). Both types of infections look the same. \\nActinomycetomas progress to bone invasion more rapidly than eumycetomas. \\nActinomycetomas also occur more frequently on the chest, abdomen, and head compared \\nwith eumycetoma, which occurs primarily on the extremities. Symptoms are similar for \\nbacterial and fungal mycetoma. Both appear as firm, painless masses under the skin. These \\nmasses usually appear on a person?s foot but can form anywhere on the body. Mycetoma \\nmasses start small, but over time they can grow larger and develop oozing sores. The \\naffected limb can become deformed or unusable. The discharge from the oozing sores can \\ncontain sand-like particles called \"grains,\" that can be white, yellow, red, brown, or black. \\nBecause lesions are usually painless and slowly progressive, time from initial infection to \\ninitiation of care varies from months to years. If left untreated or treatment fails, it can \\nspread to other areas of the body and even result in blood infections. Long-term mycetoma \\ncan eventually destroy the underlying muscle and bone. Mycetoma is a health problem in \\nequatorial regions of Africa, Latin America, and Asia known as the ?mycetoma belt.\" In the \\nAmericas, actinomycetoma is more common while both actinomycetoma and eumycetoma \\ncan be commonly diagnosed in Africa and Asia. Mycetoma affects people of all ages and is \\nmore common in men. Many people with mycetoma work in agricultural jobs, such as \\nfarmers and livestock herders. People affected by mycetoma often live in remote areas \\nwhere they have limited access to healthcare and medications. Mycetoma can cause severe \\nphysical disabilities that can force people to stop working and cause stigma. Mycetoma is \\nusually caused when skin is broken and exposed to soil or water containing the causative \\nbacteria or fungi. These germs can enter the body through wounds or other small skin \\ninjuries, like a thorn prick. It is not known why only some people develop mycetoma, but \\naspects of the environment and living conditions are likely involved. Mycetoma does not \\nspread between people. Healthcare providers and researchers believe that wearing shoes \\nmight prevent injuries that can lead to mycetoma.  Early detection and treatment, before \\nsymptoms cause serious effects, can reduce disabilities from mycetoma and may cure the \\ncondition. The number of people with mycetoma worldwide is not known. There were \\n19,494 cases reported in a 2020 review of scientific articles between 1876 and 2019. The \\nactual number of cases is likely substantially higher. Mycetoma has rarely been reported in \\nthe United States in recent decades. Data from 2017 to 2021 found 238 cases of \\neumycetoma. Most patients were female, over 65 years old, and lived in urban areas. There \\nis low risk for travel-associated mycetoma. To diagnose mycetoma, healthcare providers \\ntake a small sample (biopsy) of the infected area. Biopsies are examined in laboratories. An \\nX-ray or ultrasound may be used to assess damage to muscle and bone. Patients can avoid \\nlong-term infection and amputation by seeking care and detecting and treating mycetoma '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 556, 'page_label': '639'}, page_content='early. Therapies that work against mycetoma are limited. The treatment for mycetoma \\ndepends on whether it is caused by bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). \\nActinomycetoma is usually treatable with antibiotics, and surgery is usually not needed. \\nEumycetoma is usually treated with long-term antifungal medicine.

In very rare cases,Naegleria fowlerihas been \\nfound in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and other recreational venues. \\nThe ameba also has been found in tap water. If water containing the ameba goes up the nose \\nand to the brain, it can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis \\n(PAM). Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM. Nearly everyone \\nwho gets PAM dies from it. Between 1962 and 2023, there were 164 reported cases of PAM \\nin the United States. Only four have survived. Early symptoms of PAM can include headache, \\nfever, nausea, and vomiting. PAM progresses rapidly. Most people with PAM die within 1 to \\n18 days after symptoms begin. It usually leads to coma and death after 5 days. As PAM \\nprogresses, symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and \\nsurroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations. Brain infections caused byNaegleria \\nfowleriusually occur after someone goes swimming or diving in a lake, river, or other fresh \\nwater during summer months. Infections often happen when it's been hot for long periods, \\nresulting in higher water temperatures and lower water levels. A few infections have \\noccurred when people used tap water that containedNaegleria fowlerito rinse their sinuses \\nor cleanse their nasal passages. In very rare instances, people have become infected from \\nrecreational water like splash pads and a surf park that did not have enough chlorine. You \\ncannot get aNaegleria fowleriinfection from swallowing water containing the ameba. You \\nalso can't get an infection from someone else or pass it on to others. To help protect yourself \\nagainst aNaegleria fowleriinfection: ANaegleria fowleriinfection is diagnosed using \\nlaboratory tests.

National Influenza Vaccination Week (NIVW) is an annual observance in December \\nto remind everyone 6 months and older that there's still time to get vaccinated against flu. \\nVaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious \\nflu complications, including pregnant women and young children. Millions of children get \\nsick with flu every year, and thousands will be hospitalized as a result. During pregnancy, \\nyou also are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. Since flu viruses are \\nconstantly changing and protection from vaccination decreases over time, getting a flu \\nvaccine every year is the best way to reduce your risk from flu. A flu vaccine is the only \\nvaccine that protects against flu and has been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, \\nhospitalization, and death. Together, we can use NIVW as a nationwide call to action to \\nencourage everyone 6 months and older to get their annual flu vaccine, especially pregnant \\nwomen, young children, and others at higher risk.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that \\nlives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist \\nclimates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical \\ndiseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected \\npopulations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and \\neffective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in \\nthe affected communities. Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's \\nintestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when \\ninfected people defecate (poop) outside, useunimproved sanitation facilities(when there is \\nno sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as \\nfertilizer. Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites \\nglobally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. \\nThey may occur in temperate climates during warmer months.

People with only a few worms \\n(light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can \\ncause a range of health problems, including To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted \\nhelminth infections Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it \\nfor a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope. Only prescription drugs can \\ntreat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and \\nmebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and \\nthree days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your \\nhealthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite. In certain \\ntropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-\\ntransmitted helminth infections (hookworm,?Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often \\nreceive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or \\n\"preventive chemotherapy\". The high-risk groups identified by the World Health \\nOrganization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including \\npregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and \\nadults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs \\noften provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger \\nchildren. Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other \"neglected tropical diseases\" \\n(NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, \\nsometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and \\ninexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases. \\nWhipworm, hookworm, andAscarisare the three types of soil-transmitted helminths \\n(parasitic worms).

It is very common, especially among young people ages 15-24 \\nyears. Most women with gonorrhea do not have any symptoms. Even when a woman has \\nsymptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. \\nSymptoms in women can include: Men who do have symptoms may have: Rectal infections \\nmay either cause no symptoms or cause symptoms in both men and women that may \\ninclude: See your healthcare provider if you notice any of these symptoms. You should also \\nsee a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an \\nunusual sore, a smelly discharge, burning when peeing, or bleeding between periods.

If you are a sexually active woman, you should get tested for \\ngonorrhea every year if you are: Testing is also recommended during pregnancyin some \\ncases. Most of the time, a healthcare provider will use a a urine sample to diagnose \\ngonorrhea. However, if you have had oral and/or anal sex, your healthcare provider may \\nuse swabs to collect samples from your throat and/or rectum. In some cases, a healthcare \\nprovider may also use a swab to collect a sample from a man's urethra (urine canal) or a \\nwoman's cervix (opening to the womb). Yes, the right treatment can cure gonorrhea. It is \\nimportant that you take all of the medicine your healthcare provider gives you to cure your \\ninfection. Do not share medicine for gonorrhea with anyone. Although medicine will stop \\nthe infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the disease. It is becoming \\nharder to treat some gonorrhea, asdrug-resistant strains of gonorrheaare increasing. Return \\nto a healthcare provider if your symptoms continue for more than a few days after receiving \\ntreatment. Wait seven days after finishing all medicine before having sex. You and your sex \\npartner(s) should avoid having sex until you have each completed treatment and your \\nsymptoms are gone. This will help prevent you and your partner(s) from giving or getting \\ngonorrhea again. Those with gonorrhea should be retested about three months after \\ntreatment of an initial infection, even if their partners received successful treatment. If \\nyou've had gonorrhea and took medicine in the past, you can still get it again. This happens \\nif you have sex without a condom with a person who has gonorrhea. Untreated gonorrhea \\ncan cause serious and permanent health problems. In women, untreated gonorrhea can \\ncausepelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Some of the complications of PID are: In men, \\ngonorrhea can cause a painful condition in the tubes attached to the testicles, which can, in \\nrare cases, lead to infertility. Rarely, untreated gonorrhea can also spread to your blood or \\njoints. This condition can be life-threatening. Untreated gonorrhea may also increase your \\nchances of getting or giving HIV.

This infection occurs after a person swallows tapeworm eggs. The larvae get into \\ntissues such as muscle, brain, and eye, and form cysts called cysticerci. When cysts are \\nfound in the brain or central nervous system, it is called neurocysticercosis. Signs and \\nsymptoms depend on the location and number of cysts in your body. Symptoms can occur \\nmonths to years after infection, usually when the cysts start dying. You get cysticercosis \\nwhen you swallow tapeworm (T. solium) eggs. The eggs are passed in the feces (poop) of \\nsomeone with a tapeworm. Tapeworm eggs can get in or on food, water, or surfaces \\ncontaminated with feces. People swallow the eggs when they consume contaminated food \\nor water or put contaminated fingers in their mouth. Autoinfection is when someone with a \\ntapeworm infects themselves with tapeworm eggs. They can also infect others in the family. \\nEating pork cannot give you cysticercosis. You can take steps to prevent cysticercosis. If you \\nthink that you may have cysticercosis, please see your healthcare provider. They will ask \\nyou about: Diagnosing neurocysticercosis typically involves MRI or CT brain scans and \\nsometimes blood tests. Blood tests might not show positive results in mild infections. If \\nsurgery is needed, a pathologist will examine the cyst for diagnosis. See additional \\ninformation on testing for intestinal tapeworm infections on thetaeniasissite. Infections are \\ngenerally treated with a combination of anti-parasitic drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs. \\nSurgery is sometimes necessary to treat cysts depending on: Treatment isn't always \\nnecessary for every case of cysticercosis. Even if you don't need treatment to kill the \\nparasite, you may need treatment for the symptoms caused by the infection, such as \\nmedication to reduce seizures. Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the \\nparasiteTaenia solium.

They are vesicants (agents that cause blisters) similar to \\nthesulfur mustards. The nitrogen mustards are also known by their military names of HN-1, \\nHN-2, and HN-3. Traits of nitrogen mustards include: Nitrogen mustards are not found \\nnaturally in the environment. The nitrogen mustards were never used in warfare. HN-1 \\noriginally was designed to remove warts but was later found to be a potential chemical \\nwarfare agent. HN-2 was designed as a military agent but was later used in cancer \\ntreatment. Other treatment agents have now replaced it. HN-3 was designed only for \\nmilitary purposes. Nitrogen mustards are powerful irritants. This means it is a substance \\nthat can cause pain, itching, or discomfort. Nitrogen mustards can damage the skin, eyes, \\nand respiratory (breathing) tract. They can enter the body's cells very quickly and damage \\nthe immune system and bone marrow. Effects caused by nitrogen mustards depend on the \\namount, how someone was exposed, and how long they were exposed. Usually, signs and \\nsymptoms of nitrogen mustard exposure do not happen immediately. Depending on the \\nlevel of exposure, symptoms may not occur for several hours. Nitrogen mustard can have \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 583, 'page_label': '666'}, page_content='different effects on specific parts of the body. Showing these signs or symptoms does not \\nnecessarily mean that a person has been exposed to a nitrogen mustard. The following may \\nhappen after a large exposure: The following may happen after exposure: The following \\nmay happen after exposure: High levels of nitrogen mustard can cause burns and blindness. \\nThe following may happen within hours: Fluid in the lungs is uncommon. Redness usually \\ndevelops within several hours after exposure. Blisters show up within 6 to 12 hours. People \\ncould be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing it in. Because it is heavier \\nthan air, nitrogen mustard gas will sink to lower areas. People can be exposed by touching \\nor drinking the water. People can also be exposed by touching liquid nitrogen mustards \\ndirectly. Because no cure exists for nitrogen mustard exposure, the best thing to do is avoid \\nit. If the nitrogen mustard release was indoors, get out of the building. If the release was \\noutdoors, move away from the area, stay upwind if possible, and go to higher ground. \\nMoving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the chance of death. If you are near \\na nitrogen mustard release, emergency teams may tell you toevacuate the areaor \"shelter in \\nplace\" inside. Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it \\nover the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas and take off the clothes \\nquickly. As quickly as possible, wash any nitrogen mustard from your skin with lots of soap \\nand water. Washing with soap and water will help protect you from any chemicals on your \\nbody. If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for \\n10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. \\nDo not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you \\nwear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after \\nyou wash them. After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do \\nnot touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you have to touch unsafe areas, or you aren\\'t sure \\nwhere the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, \\nor similar objects to put the clothing in the bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing \\nshould also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. Tie \\nthe bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this \\nway helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When \\nthe local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with \\nyour clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. \\nDo not handle the plastic bags yourself. No cure exists for nitrogen mustard exposure. \\nTreatment involves removing nitrogen mustard from the body as soon as possible and \\nproviding supportive medical care in a hospital setting. The long-term health effects depend \\non the way in which you were exposed: Nitrogen mustards may cause bone marrow \\nsuppression beginning as early as 3 to 5 days after exposure. Bone marrow suppression can \\ncause anemia, bleeding, and higher chances of infection. If severe, these effects could lead to \\ndeath. Breathing in large amounts of the gas can cause chronic respiratory disease (long-\\nterm breathing issues). Prolonged (long exposures) or repeated exposures to nitrogen \\nmustards have caused cancer in animals.

Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher \\nrisk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and other health \\nissues. Although there is no one solution, there are many ways parents and caregivers can \\nhelp children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits. About 1 in 5 \\nAmerican children have obesity. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with \\nobesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 \\ndiabetes, and risk factors for heart disease such as high blood pressure. Obesity also has an \\nimpact on medical costs. Compared to children with healthy weight, total medical \\nexpenditures for children with severe obesity are $909 higher each year. Children with \\nobesity are more likely to have obesity as adults. Adults with obesity have higher risks for \\nstroke,many types of cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, premature death, and mental \\nillness, such as clinical depression and anxiety. Factors that influence obesity include \\ngenetics, eating patterns, physical activity levels, access to health care,  and sleep routines. \\nAlso, conditions where we live, learn, work, and play can make healthy eating and getting \\nenough physical activity difficult.

Good sleep helps prevent type 2 diabetes, obesity, injuries, and problems with \\nattention and behavior. Children who don't get enough sleep are at risk for unhealthy \\nweight gain. Researchers are still trying to learn how sleep is linked to weight gain. Some \\nreasons might include that lack of sleep can cause a child to eat more or to be less physically \\nactive because of to lack of energy. Preschoolers need 10?13 hours of sleep per day, \\nincluding naps. Children 6?12 years old need 9?12 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night, and \\nyouth 13?17 need 8?10 hours. Staying with a consistent sleep schedule, including on \\nweekends, canhelp children sleep better. During childhood, too much screen time can lead \\nto poor sleep, weight gain,lower grades in school, and poor mental health.

When looking for \\nECE programs for your child, ask about policies and practices related to breastfeeding and \\nfeeding breast milk to infants, nutrition standards for the food served, access to outdoor \\nphysical activity during the day, and how much time the child will spend daily in front of a \\nscreen. If you are concerned about your child's weight, talk with their health care provider. \\nThey can assess the health risks related to excess weight.

A PMR greater than 100 indicates that a \\nparticular cause accounts for a greater proportion of deaths in the population of interest \\nthan is expected based on the proportion of deaths due to this cause in all workers. \\nConfidence intervals that do not include 100 indicate that the PMR is unexpectedly high or \\nlow. PMRs can be computed when the underlying population at risk cannot be determined \\n(lack of denominator data for calculating rates). For example, data can be analyzed by \\ndemographic subgroups including racial/ethnic groups to monitor for inequities. A PMR for \\none cause of death is dependent on other causes of death, if one cause of death is elevated \\nother causes of death will be depressed. \\nPMRs may bias risk estimates toward the null.

It is important to understand how \\nmuch exposure to a hazard will present health risks to workers to appropriately eliminate, \\ncontrol, and reduce those risks. The aim of a risk assessment is to answer three basic \\nquestions: NIOSH conducts risk assessments on chemical hazards including: See Current \\nIntelligence Bulletin 69 inSelected Reportsbelow to learn more about how NIOSH conducts \\noccupational risk assessments. NIOSH prioritizes chemicals for risk assessment by \\nevaluating the needs of key stakeholders and partners such as the Occupational Safety and \\nHealth Administration, the Mining Safety and Health Administration, organized labor, '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 595, 'page_label': '678'}, page_content=\"industry, and National Occupational Research Agenda councils.NIOSH also considers factors \\nsuch as how much of the chemical is used in the workplace, how much potential there is for \\nworker exposure, and the severity of the health effects. This includes an evaluation of the \\navailable scientific information on the hazard and its associated injury or disease. NIOSH \\nhas a three-step process for conducting occupational risk assessments as shown below. Risk \\nassessments have direct impact among the occupational safety and health community, \\nproviding quantitative information on hazardous chemicals, of particular use to employers, \\nworkers, researchers, safety and health professionals, and standard- and recommendation-\\nsetting organizations. NIOSH risk assessments support NIOSH authoritative \\nrecommendations to reduce hazardous exposures to workers. Employers and occupational \\nsafety and health professionals can use this information to take precautionary measures to \\nminimize exposure to workers from these hazards. These measures can include elimination, \\nsubstitution with less hazardous chemicals, engineering controls, and the use of personal \\nprotective equipment. NIOSH uses risk assessments in authoritative recommendations to \\nreduce hazardous exposures to workers. The Occupational Safety and Health \\nAdministration (OSHA) has incorporated NIOSH risk assessments into workplace standards. \\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also used NIOSH risk assessments to \\nsupport environmental assessments. State agencies and other entities setting occupational \\nexposure limits have used NIOSH recommendations based on risk assessments. NIOSH \\nwork on risk assessment methods has had an impact on the field of risk assessment by \\nexpanding the methods available and better characterizing exposure-response model \\nuncertainty. Risk assessment methods development is a critical focus to provide the most \\nstatistically sound risk assessments. Methods to improve risk assessment modeling and \\ncharacterization of model uncertainty include model averaging and semi-parametric \\nmodeling. These methods are important to assessing risk as often data regarding a \\nparticular hazard are scarce; these methods allow NIOSH staff to maximize the utility of \\navailable data. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 established NIOSH as a \\nresearch agency focused on the study of worker safety and health, and empowering \\nemployers and workers to create safe and healthy workplaces.

Because of this, researchers have \\ndeveloped many ways to assess the effects of chemicals that workers inhale. However, there \\nare fewer methods to assess skin exposures. NIOSH assignsskin notationsfor individual \\nchemicals or chemical compounds. Skin notations describe what happens when chemicals \\ncontact the skin and directly damage organs or prompt the body's immune response. The \\nimmune response causes skin conditions like allergic contact dermatitis or skin irritation. \\nOccupational skin disease are one of the most common types of workplace diseases. They \\ncan take different forms, such as: Dermal absorption happens when a chemical goes through \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 596, 'page_label': '679'}, page_content='the skin and travels into the body. Many chemicals used in the workplace can damage \\norgans if they penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream. Examples of these chemicals \\ninclude pesticides and organic solvents. How fast the skin absorbs chemicals depends \\nlargely on the outer layer of the skin called the stratum corneum.The stratum corneum \\nprovides a barrier by keeping molecules from passing into and out of the skin. This barrier \\nprotects the lower layers of skin. How much the skin absorbs chemicals depends on the \\nfollowing factors: Contact dermatitis, also called eczema, happens when the skin becomes \\ninflamed from contact with a chemical. Contact dermatitis is the most common form of \\nreported occupational skin disease. Research suggests that contact dermatitis makes up \\n90?95% of occupational skin disease cases in the United States. Common symptoms of \\ndermatitis include the following: Irritant contact dermatitisinvolves a chemical directly \\ndamaging and inflaming skin. The damage often occurs only to the place where the skin \\nabsorbs the chemical. The following factors may cause irritant contact dermatitis: Allergic \\ncontact dermatitishappens when a chemical that the skin absorbs causes the body\\'s \\nimmune system to produce an allergic reaction. For this to happen, a worker must be \\nsensitive or allergic to the allergen. When the skin absorbs the chemical allergen again, the \\nchemical may cause an immune reaction that inflames the skin. The reaction can go beyond \\nthe place where the skin absorbed the chemical. The following factors may cause allergic \\ncontact dermatitis: The symptoms and the appearance of irritant contact dermatitis and \\nallergic contact dermatitis are similar. Clinical testing (such as patch testing) is often \\nnecessary to tell the difference between them. Contact dermatitis can be mild or severe, \\ndepending on many factors that include the following: The Occupational Safety and Health \\nAct of 1970 established NIOSH as a research agency focused on the study of worker safety \\nand health, and empowering employers and workers to create safe and healthy workplaces. \\nLanguages Language Assistance \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------- \\nDisease: Occupational Stress — see Stress, Occupational \\nURL: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/stress \\nDisease Information: Job stress can be defined as the harmful physical and emotional \\nresponses that occur when the requirements of a job do not match the capabilities, \\nresources, or needs of the worker.

This is a 77% increase since 2004.1 Driving helps \\nolder adults stay mobile and independent. But the risk of being injured or killed in a traffic \\ncrash increases as people age. Thankfully, older adults can take steps to stay safer on the \\nroads. In 2022, about 9,100 older adults were killed in traffic crashes, and over 270,000 \\nwere treated in emergency departments for crash injuries.2This means that each day, 25 \\nolder adults are killed and over 740 are injured in crashes. The good news is that older \\nadults are more likely to have safer driving behaviors than other age groups. Taking these \\nkey steps can help adults of all ages, including older adults, stay safe on the road: Seat belt \\nuse is one of the most effective ways to save lives and reduce injuries in crashes.6 Drive \\nduring daylight and in good weather. Conditions such as poor weather7and driving at \\nnight8increase the likelihood of crash injuries and deaths.

OHF was identified between 1945 and 1947 in Omsk, Russia. OHF occurs in \\nRussia--specifically, in the western Siberia regions of Omsk, Novosibirsk, Kurgan, and \\nTyumen. While there is not treatment for OHF, most people recover after 1 or 2 weeks. \\nAbout 5 to 30 people out of 1,000 with OHF die of the disease. OHF is rare and is unlikely to \\npose a public health threat to people living in the United States. People with OHF may '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 605, 'page_label': '688'}, page_content='experience chills, fever, headache, severe body aches, and vomiting. After 3 or 4 days, \\nsymptoms can include diarrhea and unexplained bleeding from the nose, eyes, or rectum. \\nAfter being sick for 1 or 2 weeks, most people with OHF fully recover. However, some \\npeople may experience a second wave of symptoms, including fever and swelling of the \\nbrain, in the third week. Rarely, OHF can cause hearing loss, hair loss, and behavior or \\npsychological conditions. Long-term supportive care may be needed for people with \\nsymptoms that impair their motor skills. People in rural or outdoor settings in western \\nSiberia have a higher risk for OHF. These people are more likely to encounter infected ticks \\nand rodents. This includes hunters, campers, forest workers, farmers, and muskrat \\ntrappers. People are more likely to be infected during the winter months. Laboratory \\nworkers handling OHF specimens without proper personal protective equipment are also at \\nrisk. People get OHF through tick bites or contact with the blood, feces, or urine of an \\ninfected animal, usually a rodent. Ticks that can spread OHF includeDermacentor \\nreticulatus,Dermacentor marginatus, andIxodes persulcatus. Rodents that can spread OHF \\ninclude the muskrat, water vole, and narrow-skulled vole. People cannot spread OHF to \\neach other. Though unusual, it is possible to get OHF without direct contact with ticks or \\nrodents. The virus that causes OHF has been found in aquatic animals and water. The virus \\nin the water could enter the body through broken skin or the eyes and nose. This would be \\nextremely rare. There is even evidence that OHF can be spread by drinking the milk of goats \\nor sheep infected with OHF. If you plan to spend time in rural or outdoor areas in western \\nSiberia, There is no vaccine currently available for OHF. However, vaccines for another \\ndisease spread by ticks (tick-borne encephalitis) may offer some protection. These can be \\nconsidered for high-risk groups, like muskrat hunters. Talk to your healthcare provider if \\nyou are traveling to the area and may have contact with animals. Healthcare providers can \\ndiagnose OHF with blood tests that detect the virus, like cell cultures and PCR.

It occurs \\nworldwide, anywhere sheep, goats and similar animals live. People can get painful sores \\ncalled lesions if they have contact with animals infected with orf virus. Certain activities like \\nfeeding, petting and getting bitten by infected animals put people more at risk for infection. \\nSimple prevention steps can protect people from the virus, even if they are handling \\ninfected animals infected with orf. An animal infected with orf virus typically has sores \\n(lesions) around its lips and muzzle and in its mouth. People infected with orf virus usually \\nget sores or nodules on their hands or forearms. This rash is infectious, meaning it can \\nspread to areas of a person's body if they scratch or touch the sores. The sores progress \\nthrough stages over six weeks. They may also have mild fever, tiredness or swelling of the \\nglands in their neck and underarms (lymph nodes). People with weakened immune systems \\ncan develop more serious symptoms if they get infected with orf virus. They may have \\nmultiple sores or large tumor-like sores. They may also develop a second type of rash that \\nisn't infectious (called erythema multiforme). People can get sore mouth disease if they \\nhave a cut or abrasion and touch an animal with orf virus. People can also get orf by \\nhandling equipment used with sick animals. Activities that may put people at more risk for \\ninfection include: Orf virus does not spread between people. People can get infected with \\norf virus multiple times. Infections after the first one are usually less severe and may heal \\nfaster. Wear rubber or latex gloves when handling sheep or goats. This is especially \\nimportant if you have cuts on your hands or are touching an animal's mouth or muzzle. \\nWash your hands often with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially if they \\nlook dirty. If there is no soap and your hands aren't visibly dirty, use alcohol-based hand \\nsanitizer.

Transplant transmitted infections are very rare; public health entities and \\nacademic groups suspect about 1% of transplants cause infections and have confirmed \\ncases in far fewer. When these events occur, the complications can include graft failure or \\ndeath. Efforts to improve transplant safety are ongoing, (for example, improvements to \\ndonor screening and donor testing) and informed by investigations of disease transmission \\nfrom transplanted organs and tissues. CDC is responsible for surveillance, detection, and \\nwarning of potential public health risks within the organ and tissue supply. These public \\nhealth efforts increase transplant safety by reducing the potential for transmission of \\ncommunicable diseases. Although infrequent, transplants can transmit infections that affect \\npatients' health, including: To the body, transplanted organs are foreign. When the body \\nattacks transplanted organs, it is known as rejection. To prevent this response, doctors \\nprescribe medication to organ recipients. A side effect of these medications is the body's \\ninability to fight infections as well as a healthy person. Most types of transplanted tissues \\n(i.e., bone, tendons, heart valves, and cornea) are not recognized as foreign and do not \\nrequire these medications. Hospitals are required to have written agreements with \\norganizations that coordinate organ and tissue donation and recovery. There are 57 organ \\nprocurement organizations (OPOs) and a larger number of tissue recovery and eye recovery \\nbanks that work with hospitals in the United States for this purpose. Hospitals also obtain \\norgans (kidneys and livers) from living donors. Organ procurement organizations (OPOs) \\nadminister questionnaires to collect: OPOs, tissue banks, and eye banks are also required to \\nperform certain tests to see if the potential donor may have infections (e.g.,human \\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV),hepatitis Borhepatitis Cvirus,syphilis,and cytomegalovirus \\n(CMV)). They provide test results to the healthcare facility where organ or tissue \\ntransplantation occur. Hospitals evaluate living potential donors for behaviors or medical \\nhistory that may increase the risk of infection in the donor. The Organ Procurement and \\nTransplantation Network (OPTN) requires organizations procuring organs to report \\nsuspected donor-derived disease transmissions to the OPTN and all centers receiving \\npotentially affected organs. Additionally, OPOs must contact tissue banks and eye banks that \\nrecovered tissues from that same donor. Tissue and eye banks are required to investigate if \\nthey suspect transplanted tissue caused an infection and: The tissue or eye bank that \\nreleased the tissue must submit findings to theFDAthrough itsMedWatchsurveillance \\nsystem.

Waterborne \\ndisease surveillance provides information that can help prevent future disease and \\noutbreaks while providing important information on how germs, chemicals, or toxins \\nspread, and which types of water are linked to people getting sick. Although we enjoy safe \\ndrinking and recreational water in the United States, waterborne diseases still pose a threat \\nto our health and productivity. Water contaminated with germs, chemicals, or toxins can \\nlead to waterborne illness if you drink it, breathe it in, or it touches your skin, eyes, ears, or \\nother mucous membranes. By collecting data on the types of water, water systems, settings, \\nand agents (what spreads the disease) that are linked to waterborne illness, we improve our \\nunderstanding of waterborne illnesses and can better guide prevention efforts. Outbreak \\ninvestigations help us learn more about the causes of outbreaks. Officials can learn what \\ngerms are causing waterborne illness, what types of water are involved, and what groups of \\npeople become ill. This knowledge can be used to control an outbreak and prevent \\nadditional illnesses. Outbreak surveillance enables public health agencies to learn lessons \\nfrom these investigations to develop recommendations on how to prevent similar \\noutbreaks from happening in the future. Many of the germs that are spread by water can \\nalso be spread in other ways, including by eating contaminated food or by contact with an ill \\nperson or animal. People come in contact with water often each day, making it even harder \\nto know which exposure might have made a person sick. Finally, it can take several days or \\neven weeks to become ill after being exposed to a germ, making it difficult to pinpoint the \\nplace and time of exposure.Without an outbreak investigation, it can be difficult or \\nimpossible to link illnesses to water. When a group of people become ill at the same time, an \\ninvestigation that collects information on timing and location of exposures and illnesses \\n(known as an epidemiologic investigation) can help determine where and when the \\noutbreak started and what caused it. An outbreak investigation can sometimes identify a \\ndirect link between the illnesses and contaminated water and might identify the type of \\nwater, systems, or settings involved. This information is difficult to gather outside of an \\noutbreak (such as with individual infections). For an event to be defined as a waterborne \\ndisease outbreak Public health officials have been tracking waterborne disease in the \\nUnited States for more than 100 years. CDC has been overseeing national waterborne \\ndisease and outbreak trackingsince 1971. Surveillance data help guide efforts to reduce and \\nprevent future outbreaks. Waterborne disease surveillance data have supported national \\nefforts to develop drinking water regulations and have provided guidance for recreational \\nwater activities, such as CDC'sHealthy Swimmingprogram. The nationalWaterborne Disease \\nand Outbreak Surveillance System(WBDOSS) collects data on waterborne disease and \\noutbreaks associated with recreational water, drinking water, and environmental and \\nundetermined exposures to water. The system collects data on the number of outbreak-\\nassociated illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths; agents; implicated types of water; water \\nsystems; and water settings. WBDOSS also collects information on single cases of \\nwaterborne illness caused by certain types of chemicals or germs. Public health officials \\ninvestigate outbreaks to control them, to prevent additional illnesses, and to learn how to \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 615, 'page_label': '698'}, page_content=\"prevent similar outbreaks from happening.

The 8 steps in an outbreak \\ninvestigation are: Several steps may happen at the same time in an outbreak investigation. \\nOnce a waterborne disease outbreak investigation ends, public health departments report \\noutbreaks to WBDOSS. Waterborne disease outbreaks became nationally notifiable in the \\nUnited States in 2009. Public health agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. \\nterritories, and Freely Associated States have primary responsibility for identifying and \\ninvestigating waterborne outbreaks and reporting outbreaks voluntarily to CDC. From 1971 \\nto 2008, outbreaks were reported using a paper form. Since 2009, outbreaks have been \\nreported electronically through CDC'sNational Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). See also \\nAgricultural Water Outbreak Investigation Tools.

The sample \\nis sent to a laboratory for a fungal culture or to be examined under the microscope. A blood \\ntest can also help diagnose paracoccidioidomycosis. Paracoccidioidomycosis is treated with \\nantifungal medicines such as itraconazole and amphotericin B. While antibiotic medicines \\nare made to kill bacteria and not fungi, an antibiotic medicine called \\ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) can help treat infections. TMP/SMX is also \\nknown as co-trimoxazole and by several different brand names, including Bactrim, Septra, \\nand Cotrim. Patients usually need treatment for about one year.

In the United States, paraquat is usually \\navailable as a liquid with different levels of strength. The US Environmental Protection \\nAgency classifies paraquat as \"restricted use.\"1This means that it can be used only by \\npeople who have licenses. Because paraquat is highly poisonous, the United States requires \\nthe following safety measures: Paraquat from outside the United States may not have these \\nprotections added. Paraquat was first produced for commercial purposes in 1961. \\nWorldwide, paraquat is still one of the most commonly used herbicides (plant killers). In \\nthe United States, due to its harmfulness, paraquat is only available for use by commercially '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 627, 'page_label': '710'}, page_content='licensed users. Paraquat causes direct damage when it comes into contact with the lining of \\nthe mouth, stomach, or intestines. After paraquat enters the body, it spreads to all areas of \\nthe body. Paraquat causes toxic chemical reactions to occur throughout many parts of the \\nbody, mostly the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Cells pick and choose how they let paraquat into \\nthe cells. This is likely because of \"active transport,\" the moving of stuff in and out of the \\ncell. The level of paraquat poisoning depends on the amount, how someone was exposed, \\nand how long they were exposed. It also depends on the person\\'s health condition when \\nthey were exposed. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a \\nperson has been exposed to paraquat. Swallowing small to medium amounts of paraquat \\nmay lead to these signs and symptoms within several days to several weeks: Swallowing \\nlarge amounts of paraquat leads to the following signs/symptoms within a few hours to a \\nfew days: After a person swallows a large amount of paraquat, the following may occur: If \\nthese gastrointestinal symptoms are severe, it may cause the following: People with licenses \\nto use paraquat are the most at risk for exposure. Paraquat is not known to have been used \\nin any terrorist attacks or wars. The most likely way to be poisoned by paraquat is ingestion \\n(swallowing). \\nParaquat can be mixed easily with food, water, or other beverages. Eating or drinking food \\nor beverages with paraquat could poison people. Protections include the blue dye, odor \\n(smell), and vomiting agent. If the paraquat does not have protections, people might not \\nknow that the food, water, or other beverages are unsafe. Paraquat poisoning is also \\npossible after skin exposure. Poisoning is more likely if skin exposure lasts for a long time \\nor a strong version of paraquat is used. Poisoning is also more likely to happen if paraquat \\ntouches skin that has sores, cuts, or a severe rash. If it is breathed in, paraquat could cause \\npoisoning that causes lung damage. In the past, some marijuana in the United States has \\nbeen found to have paraquat. Most people are exposed by swallowing paraquat. Do not \\nswallow more paraquat if you think you are poisoned. Actions you can take before going to \\nthe hospital may include swallowing activated charcoal or Fuller\\'s earth. This will stick to \\nthe swallowed paraquat. If you think you were exposed to liquid paraquat, do the following. \\nTake off the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the \\nhead. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas and take off the clothes quickly. \\nAs quickly as possible, wash any liquid paraquat from your skin with lots of soap and water. \\nIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to \\n15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not \\nput the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear \\neyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you \\nwash them. After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid \\ntouching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can\\'t avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren\\'t \\nsure where they are, wear rubber gloves.

You can find them mostly on your head, but also on your eyebrows and \\neyelashes. Adult head lice are roughly 2 ? 3 mm long (about the size of a sesame seed). Both \\nover-the-counter and prescription medications are available to treat head lice in your hair \\n(infestation). People with head lice may not have symptoms, particularly with a first \\ninfestation or when an infestation is light. Itching (pruritus) is the most common symptom \\nof head lice infestation. It is caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites. It may take four to \\nsix weeks for itching to appear the first time a person has head lice. Other symptoms may \\ninclude the following: Head lice do not transmit any disease and therefore are not \\nconsidered a health hazard. In the United States, infestation with head lice is most common \\namong preschool- and elementary school-age children and their household members and \\ncaretakers. There is not reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the \\nUnited States; however, an estimated 6 ? 12 million infestations occur each year in the \\nUnited States among children 3 ? 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that girls get head \\nlice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact. In the \\nUnited States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African American \\npersons than among persons of other races. The head louse found most frequently in the \\nUnited States may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of \\nsome types of hair, but not others. Head lice mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of \\na person infested with lice. Head lice move by crawling; they cannot hop or fly. Adult lice \\ncan live on a person's head for about 30 days. However, they will die within two days if they \\nfall off a person and cannot feed. Adult female head lice are usually larger than males and \\ncan lay about six eggs each day. Nits (lice eggs) cannot hatch and usually die within a week if \\nthey are not kept at the same temperature as those found close to the scalp. Nits take about \\na week (range 6 ? 9 days) to hatch into nymphs (young lice). Nymphs look similar to adult \\nlice but are very small (size of a pinhead); they take about seven days to mature into adult \\nlice. The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who \\nalready has head lice. This contact can be common among children playing at places like \\nschool or the home. Getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of you or your \\nenvironment. Although not as common, head lice may spread by: Contracting lice from a wig \\nor hairpiece is extremely unlikely. Especially if the wig or hairpiece hasn't been worn in the \\npast 48 hours by a person with head lice. Head lice can survive under water for several \\nhours but are unlikely to spread in a swimming pool. Chlorine levels in pool water do not \\nkill head lice. Animals do not get or spread head lice. Take these steps to help prevent and \\ncontrol the spread of head lice: To help control a head lice outbreak in a community, school, \\nor camp, teach children to avoid activities that may spread head lice. For example, teach \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 634, 'page_label': '717'}, page_content=\"children to Misdiagnosis of head lice infestation is common. Finding a live nymph (baby \\nlouse) or adult louse on the scalp or hair is the best way to diagnose a head lice infestation. \\nBecause adult and nymph lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they may be \\ndifficult to find. A fine-toothed louse comb may help you find lice. If you do not see crawling \\nlice, look for nits attached firmly within ¼ inch of the base of hair shafts. You will often see \\nnits on hair behind the ears and near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than \\n¼ inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always hatched or dead. Although head lice \\nand nits can be visible with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice \\nor nits. Nits are often confused with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair \\nspray droplets, and dirt particles. If you do not see nymphs or adults, and the only nits \\nfound are more than ¼ inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and does not \\nneed treatment. Lice are parasites, or insects, found on people's heads and bodies, including \\nthe pubic area. Human lice survive by feeding on human blood.

Body lice \\ncan spread disease. They live and lay eggs on clothing and bedding used by infested people. \\nAdult body lice are small, only 2.3 ? 3.6 mm in length (about the size of a sesame seed). \\nImproved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only treatment \\nneeded for body lice infestations; however, in some cases peduculicides are recommended. \\nBody lice can spread disease (epidemic typhus,Bartonella quintana infection, andepidemic \\nrelapsing fever). Intense itching (pruritus) and rash caused by an allergic reaction to louse \\nbites are common symptoms of body lice infestation. As with other lice infestations, intense \\nitching leads to scratching which can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection of the \\nskin. When body lice infestation lasts long, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become \\nthickened and darkened, particularly in the mid-section of the body (waist, groin, upper \\nthighs). Body lice exist worldwide but usually affect people who live in crowded conditions. \\nThey affect people without access to regular bathing and clean clothes. They can spread \\nquickly in: Body lice spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice. They \\ncan also spread through contact with clothing, beds, or linens that have been in contact with \\na person infested with lice. However, in the United States, actual infestation with body lice \\ntends to occur only in people who do not have access to housing, regular bathing, or clean \\nclothes. Nits (lice eggs) take 6 ? 9 days to hatch. Nits are tiny (0.8 ? 0.3 mm) and hard to see; \\nthey can be confused for dandruff. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) are about the size of a \\npinhead and take about a week to grow into adults. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame \\nseed, have six legs, and are tan to grayish white. Adult females can lay up to eight nits per \\nday. Adult lice need to feed on blood several times each day; without blood meals, the louse \\nwill die within 1 ? 2 days off the host. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice. \\nTake these steps to help prevent and control the spread of body lice: You can diagnose body \\nlice infestation by finding eggs and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes you \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 635, 'page_label': '718'}, page_content=\"can see a body louse crawling or feeding on the skin. Although body lice and nits can be \\nlarge enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or \\neggs. See a healthcare provider if you are unsure about an infestation. You can treat a body \\nlice infestation by improving personal hygiene. Bathe and change into clean clothes at least \\nonce a week. Wash clothing, bedding, and towels used by the person infested with lice using \\nhot water (at least 130°F) and machine dry using the hot cycle. Pediculicide, a medicine that \\ncan kill lice, is sometimes used for treatment. If prescribed a pediculicide, apply it exactly as \\ndirected on the bottle or by your healthcare provider.

Bamboo rats can also get talaromycosis but there is no \\nevidence that it spreads from rats to people. Talaromycosis does not spread from person to \\nperson. In Thailand, infections are more common during rainy seasons so rain might \\npromote the growth of the fungus. Talaromyces marneffeican change from its native mold \\nform in the environment to a parasitic yeast once in a warm-blooded host.In the \\nenvironment (at 25°C), the mold form produces yellow green colonies and a characteristic \\nsoluble red pigment (1). The mold produces spores that are easily aerosolized (2). The \\nspores are inhaled by the host and are settled into the lungs (3), where they are \\nphagocytosed by the host's alveolar macrophages (4). The higher body temperature (at \\n37°C) triggers a morphologic change from the mold to a yeast form, which uniquely divides \\nby binary fission forming a characteristic midline septum (5). The yeasts multiply until they \\ncause rupture of the macrophage (6), releasing yeasts that can spread within the lungs and \\ncan disseminate to other organs. At the demise of the hosts, the yeast returns to the mold, in \\nabundance, and the cycle repeats. A healthcare provider might prescribe medicine to \\nprevent talaromycosis in high-risk individuals. This includes people with weakened \\nimmune systems and who live in places where the fungus is present. Itraconazole is the \\nmost commonly used medicine to prevent talaromycosis.

PPT in this context is defined as the technical methods (e.g., fit testing methods), \\nprocesses, techniques, tools, and materials that support the development and use of \\npersonal protective equipment (PPE) worn by individuals to reduce the effects of their \\nexposure to a hazard. The PPT Program is responsible for testing and approving new \\nrespirators before they enter the market. This ensures that NIOSH-approved respirators \\nmeet the minimum construction, performance, and respiratory protection standards to \\nkeep users safe. The program conducts post-market activities such as the Long-Term Field \\nEvaluation Program, the Certified Product Investigation Process, and the site and product \\naudit programs. In addition, the PPT program works to evaluate and improve equipment \\nworn by workers by conducting research on new technologies, emerging hazards, and PPE \\ntest methods. Based on the research, the Program is able to develop and implement science-\\nbased national guidance for respiratory and other personal protective technologies.

The \\nPesticide Illness and Injury Surveillance Program was developed to examine over-exposure \\nto pesticides in the workplace. We use this knowledge to prevent these exposures from \\nhappening. This kind of surveillance also serves as an early warning system for any harmful \\neffects not detected by pesticide manufacturer testing. Data sources We use two data \\nsources to monitor the trends in pesticide-related illnesses and injuries that occur on the \\njob: TheSENSOR Programbuilds and maintains occupational illness and injury surveillance \\nwithin state health departments. One of the conditions supported under SENSOR is acute \\noccupational pesticide-related illness and injury. This is referred to as the \"SENSOR-\\nPesticides\" program. Using cooperative agreement funds from NIOSH and the EPA, health \\ndepartments conduct surveillance on acute occupational pesticide-related illnesses or \\ninjuries. States participating in the SENSOR-Pesticides program receive federal funding \\nand/or technical support. If your state\\'s health department wants toparticipate in the \\nSENSOR-Pesticides program, pleasecontact us. The SENSOR-Pesticides Program is \\nrecognized nationally as providing critical information for occupational and public health: \\nBesides the SENSOR-Pesticides Program data, we also use NPDS data for acute pesticide \\nillness and injury surveillance. In the United States, poison control centers receive phone \\ncalls reporting instances of poison exposure to adults and children. These centers serve all \\n50 states and the District of Columbia. Every phone call received is documented in \\ntheNational Poison Data System (NPDS). The NPDS data are updated regularly.

Travelers taking a companion or service animal \\nto a foreign country must meet the entry requirements of that country and follow \\ntransportation guidelines of the airline or cruise company. Additionally, upon reentering the \\nUnited States, pets that traveled abroad are subject to the same import requirements as \\nanimals that never lived in the United States (see Sec. 4, Ch. 9,Bringing Animals & Animal \\nProducts into the United States). See general information abouttraveling with a pet. For \\ndestination country requirements, travelers should contact the country?s embassy in \\nWashington, DC, or the nearest consulate. The International Air Transportation Association \\nalso lists therequirements for pets to enter countries. Airline and cruise companies are \\nanother resource for travelers; most have webpages dedicated to traveling with pets. \\nPeople planning to travel outside the United States with a pet should contact their local \\nveterinarian well in advance of departure for assistance with completing all necessary \\npaperwork and ensuring animal health and medical requirements are met. Depending on \\nthe destination country, pets might be required to have updated vaccinations and parasite \\ntreatments, International Standards Organization?compatible microchips implanted, and \\nserologic tests prior to travel. Some countries require a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\\n19) test for pets prior to importation. Completing the stringent testing and permit \\nrequirements for some countries (e.g., Australia) can take up to 6 months. People who plan \\nto transport animals should consider the animals? species (e.g., cat, dog); mode of travel \\n(e.g., airplane, cruise ship); season of travel (some carriers will not transport animals during \\nthe hottest or coldest parts of the year); and vaccination and testing requirements of the \\ndestination country and of transiting countries, if applicable. Transportation carriers might \\nhave additional requirements (e.g., breed restrictions for pets traveling in cargo, health \\ncertificates), so travelers intending to take pets outside the United States should contact air \\nand cruise lines for information as soon as they are aware of their travel plans. The US \\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) \\nlistsinternational export regulations for pets. Pet owners are responsible for making sure \\nrequirements of the destination country are met. USDA APHIS often is required to endorse a \\nhealth certificate prior to an animal leaving the United States; certificates must be accurate, \\ncomplete, and legible. Failure to meet destination country requirements can cause problems \\ngaining certificate endorsement or difficulties upon arrival in the destination country (e.g., \\nanimal quarantine or retesting). Travelers should be aware that long flights can be hard on \\npets, particularly older animals, animals with chronic health conditions, very young animals, \\nand short-nosed breeds (e.g., Persian cats, English bulldogs) that can be predisposed to \\nrespiratory stress. The US Department of Transportation offers tips fortraveling with \\nanimals by plane. The Department of Justice (DOJ) Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) \\ndefines a service animal as any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks \\nfor the benefit of a person with a disability, including an intellectual, mental, physical, \\npsychiatric, or sensory disability.

The cabins of most commercial airplanes are highly confined \\nspaces; passengers are seated in close quarters with limited opportunities to separate \\npassengers from nearby disturbances. Animals on airplanes can pose a risk to the health, \\nsafety, and well-being of passengers and crew, and could disturb the safe and efficient \\noperation of the aircraft. Accommodation of passengers traveling with service animals \\nonboard a commercial airplane must be balanced against these concerns. The Federal \\nAviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2018 developed minimum standards \\nfor service animals. Airline carriers can require passengers traveling with a service animal \\nto document whether that animal has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks \\nto assist the function of the passenger with a physical or mental disability; has been trained \\nto behave in public; is in good health; and has the ability either not to relieve itself on a long \\n(>8 hours) flight or to do so in a sanitary manner. The US Department of Transportation \\n(DOT) provides 2 forms to document a service animal?s behavior, training, and \\nhealth:Service Animal Air Transportation Form[PDF] andService Animal Relief Attestation \\nForm for Flight Segments Eight Hours or Longer[PDF]. In addition to the requirements \\nalready mentioned, airlines might require health certificates and vaccination records. \\nAlthough airline carriers cannot restrict service dogs based solely on the breed or \\ngeneralized type of dog, they might limit the number of service animals traveling with a \\nsingle passenger with a disability, or require service animals be harnessed, leashed, or \\ntethered unless the device interferes with the service animal?s work or the passenger?s \\ndisability prevents use of these devices; in which case, the carrier must permit the \\npassenger to use signal, voice, or other effective means to maintain control of the service \\nanimal. Travelers should contact the cruise company they will be traveling with to learn \\nmore about each company?s service animal policy. Some cruise lines are unable to \\naccommodate animals onboard. Pets, service dogs in training, and emotional support dogs \\nmight not be allowed. People traveling aboard a ship with a service dog should consider \\nrules or requirements at ports of call. For instance, many ports of call have strict entry \\nrequirements for animals. Travelers with service animals should visit theUSDA?s pet travel \\nwebsiteor their service animal?s veterinarian to determine each destination country?s \\npolicy regarding admission of service animals. Some locations do not recognize 3-year \\nrabies vaccines, and annual vaccination might be required; consult with the service \\nanimal?s veterinarian for more information. Some locations require that service animals \\nreceive parasite treatment prior to arrival, and this information should be included in the \\nservice animal?s health records. Some locations require that service animals travel with \\ndocumentation (e.g., an import license), regardless of whether the service animal will \\ndisembark the ship. Check with the cruise company or country of destination for details. \\nSome locations have breed restrictions per the country?s dog ordinances. Restricted-breed \\nservice animals might not be allowed to board the ship due to the destination country?s \\nlaws. Travelers should check with the cruise line and country of destination for more \\ninformation.

Phosgene is a toxic gas or liquid that can cause damage \\nto the skin, eyes, nose, throat, and lungs. Possible characteristics of phosgene include: For \\nshipping or storing, phosgene is turned into a liquid by cooling and applying pressure. \\nWhen liquid phosgene is released, it quickly turns into a gas that stays close to the ground \\nand spreads quickly. Signs and symptoms depend on how the person was exposed, how \\nmuch they were exposed to, and how long. During or immediately after exposure to \\ndangerous levels of phosgene, the following signs and symptoms may develop: These signs \\nand symptoms may also be delayed for up to 48 hours. There are other delayed effects that \\nmay not show for up to 48 hours. These effects include: People who have been exposed to \\nphosgene should be monitored during the 48-hour period. If phosgene is in the air, people \\ncan be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the phosgene gas. Because \\nphosgene gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase the chance of \\nexposure there. The smell of phosgene is not a good enough warning that there is a \\ndangerous level in the air. At low levels of phosgene, the irritating signs and symptoms can \\nbe mild and delayed. This could cause people to not leave an unsafe area and continue to \\nbreathe in phosgene. Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with phosgene can expose \\npeople to phosgene. Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Avoid eating \\nfood that may have touched phosgene if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the \\nfood is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by \\nphosgene. Wash the outside of the container before using. People can be exposed by \\ntouching or drinking water that contains phosgene. \\n \\nIf clothing has touched liquid phosgene, people can be exposed by touching the clothing or \\nphosgene vapors (gas) from the clothing. Follow any directions by local authorities. Get \\naway from the area where the phosgene was released and breathe fresh air. If the phosgene \\nrelease was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and \\nventilation systems are turned off to make sure the phosgene does not come inside. If you \\ncannot go indoors, leave the area where the phosgene was released. If the phosgene release '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 654, 'page_label': '737'}, page_content='was indoors, get out of the building. If you cannot get away, go to the highest ground \\npossible because phosgene is heavier than air and will sink. Get clean by taking off all \\nclothes, jewelry, and accessories and showering as soon as you can. Showering is the best \\nmethod for removing phosgene from your body. Ideally, undress, blot, and shower \\nimmediately or as soon as you can, as described below. If you cannot take off all layers, take \\noff as many clothes as you can. If clothes are frozen to your body, do not try to remove until \\nno longer frozen. Instead, begin washing with a lot of lukewarm water. Then remove your \\nclothes. Avoid pulling clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, \\nclose your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the phosgene from getting \\nin your eyes, nose, or mouth. Drop clothes to the floor. If you wear contact lenses, take them \\nout and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in. Follow these steps \\nto blot your body: Repeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a \\ndifferent clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel \\neach time you repeat the process. First wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the \\nrest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with a lot of lukewarm water and mild \\nsoap (if available) for 90 seconds. Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water \\nfor 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub! If \\nyour eyes are burning or you can\\'t see normally, wash your eyes for 10 to 15 minutes with \\nlukewarm water. Do not use eye drops. Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your \\nhair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things \\nto the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body \\ntemperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool. If emergency response \\nservices are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency \\nteams. Move as far from the used items as possible. Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy \\ngloves that won\\'t let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your \\nclothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close \\nthe plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also. Do not put \\nthe bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to \\ndisturb them and touch phosgene. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for \\npick up. No known cure exists for phosgene exposure. Treatment involves removing \\nphosgene from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. \\nSupportive medical care can be given in a hospital setting or by trained emergency \\nresponders. If someone has swallowed phosgene,do notforce vomiting. Most people who \\nrecover after an exposure to phosgene make a complete recovery. However, exposure may \\nlead to chronic bronchitis (long-term inflammation in the lungs) and emphysema (lung \\ncondition that causes shortness of breath). Exposure to phosgene can also lead to reactive \\nairway dysfunction syndrome (RADS), asthma caused by chemicals.

Phosgene oxime was first made in 1929, but it has never been used \\non the battlefield. Phosgene oxime is a type of agent called an urticant or nettle agent. It \\ncauses strong itching and a rash similar to hives when it touches the skin. \\nPhosgene oxime is also called a corrosive agent because it causes a specific type of skin and \\ntissue damage. There is limited specific information on this chemical. It can be described as: \\nPhosgene oxime is not found naturally in the environment. Phosgene oxime has never been \\nused during wartime, despite being made as a chemical warfare agent. Phosgene oxime \\nvapor (gas) is heavier than air, so it will settle in lower areas. \\nPhosgene oxime does not last in the environment for very long. It breaks down in soil \\nwithin 2 hours when temperatures are normal. It breaks down in water within a few days. \\nPhosgene oxime causes instant and almost unbearable pain on exposed skin and eyes. When \\nbreathed in, it causes immediate irritation to the respiratory (breathing) tract. \\nPhosgene oxime can go through clothing and rubber faster than other chemical warfare \\nagents. Signs and symptoms occur immediately following a phosgene oxime exposure. The \\nlevel of phosgene oxime poisoning depends on the amount exposed, how the person is \\nexposed, and for how long. Phosgene oxime can have the different effects on specific parts \\nof the body. Showing these signs or symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has \\nbeen exposed to phosgene oxime. Signs and symptoms include severe pain and irritation \\nand eye tearing. There is also possible temporary blindness. Signs and symptoms include: \\nGetting phosgene oxime through the skin or breathing it in may cause: In a few seconds: \\nPain occurs. In 30 seconds: Blanching (whitening) of the skin circled by red rings will occur. \\nIn about 15 minutes: Skin starts showing hives. After 24 hours: Whitened areas of skin \\nbecome brown and die and a scab is formed. Itching and pain may continue as you heal. \\nPeople's chance of exposure depends on how close they are to the place where the \\nphosgene oxime was released. Air:People can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, \\nor breathing it in. Water:People can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains \\nphosgene oxime. Food:People can be exposed by eating the food. \\nPeople can also be exposed directly by touching liquid phosgene oxime. Get fresh air by \\nleaving the area where the phosgene oxime is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good \\nway to reduce the chances of exposure to phosgene oxime. If phosgene oxime was released \\noutside, move away from the area. Go to the highest ground possible, because phosgene \\noxime is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas. If phosgene oxime was released \\nindoors, get out of the building. Remove the clothing with liquid phosgene oxime on it as \\nquickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping \\nothers, do not touch unsafe areas and take off the clothing as quickly as possible. Wash any \\nphosgene oxime from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water \\nwill protect you and others from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or \\nyour vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear \\ncontacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in \\nyour eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with \\nsoap and water.

They are \\nshort and crab-like and look very different from head and body lice. Pubic lice typically \\nattach to hair in the pubic area. Adult pubic lice are 1.1?1.8 mm in length (size of a pencil \\ntip). Either over-the-counter or prescription medications can treat pubic lice infestations. \\nInfestation or infested person means that a person has lice. Signs and symptoms of pubic \\nlice include: Pubic lice do not transmit disease. However, you could get sores and a bacterial \\ninfection from intense scratching. Anyone can get pubic lice. Pubic lice usually spread \\nthrough sexual contact and are most common in adults. You usually get pubic lice from \\nintimate, person-to-person contact, usually sexual contact. Occasionally pubic lice can \\nspread by clothing, bedding, or (very rarely) using a toilet seat that was just used by a \\nperson infested with public lice. Adult pubic lice are found only on humans and require \\nblood to survive. They will die within 24 ? 48 hours without a blood meal. Female adult \\npubic lice lay about 30 eggs during their 3 ? 4-week life span. Eggs hatch after about a week. \\nNymphs (newly hatched lice) mature into adults over 6 to 9 days. Animals do not get or \\nspread pubic lice. Pubic lice found on the head or eyelashes of children may be an indication \\nof sexual exposure or abuse. The following are steps that can help prevent and control the \\nspread of pubic (\"crab\") lice: Pubic lice infestation is diagnosed by finding a \"crab\" louse or \\nnits on hair in the pubic region or, less commonly, elsewhere on the body. These areas \\ninclude the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, armpit, groin, torso, scalp, or anus. Pubic \\nlice are short and crab-like; they appear very different from head and body lice (I.e., they are '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 657, 'page_label': '740'}, page_content=\"broader and flatter than other lice). Although pubic lice and nits can be large enough to see \\nwith the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to see them. Lice found on the head \\ngenerally are head lice, not pubic lice. If you are unsure about infestation or if treatment is \\nnot successful, see a healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Consider getting tested for other \\nsexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You can treat pubic lice with a lice-killing lotion \\ncontaining 1% permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide. \\nThese products are available over-the-counter without a prescription at a local drug store \\nor pharmacy. These medications are safe and effective when used exactly according to the \\ninstructions in the package or on the label.

It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill. \\nMany household items including gas- and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and \\ncharcoal grills produce this poison gas. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are \\nheadache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO \\nsymptoms are often described as ?flu-like.? If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you \\npass out or kill you. People who are sleeping or drunk can die from CO poisoning before \\nthey have symptoms. Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning. Infants, the elderly, and people \\nwith chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from \\nCO. Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to \\nfires, more than 100,000 visit the emergency room, and more than 14,000 are hospitalized. \\nCO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, \\nstoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. CO can build up indoors and \\npoison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO \\npoisoning with a few small steps. Install battery-operated or battery back-up CO detectors \\nnear every sleeping area in your home. Check CO detector batteries when you change the \\ntime on your clocks each spring and fall to be sure they are functioning properly. Consider \\nbuying a detector with a digital readout. This type of detector can tell you the highest level \\nof CO concentration in your home, in addition to sounding an alarm. Replace your CO \\ndetector following the manufacturer's instructions or every 5 years.  Set a reminder on your \\nsmartphone or other device calendar when you purchase and install the detector. Have your \\nheating system, water heater, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances serviced by \\na qualified technician every year. Make sure your gas appliances are vented properly. \\nHorizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go \\ntoward outdoors, as shown below. This prevents CO from leaking if the joints or pipes aren't \\nfitted tightly. When you buy gas equipment, buy only equipment carrying the seal of a \\nnational testing agency, such as Underwriters' Laboratories. If you smell an odor from your \\ngas refrigerator, have an expert service it. An odor from your gas refrigerator can mean it \\ncould be leaking CO. Never heat your house with a gas oven. \\nDon't cook or burn anything on a stove or fireplace that isn't vented. Have your chimney \\nchecked or cleaned every year. Chimneys can be blocked by debris, which can cause CO to \\nbuild up inside your home or cabin. Never burn charcoal indoors. Burning charcoal - red, \\ngray, black, or white - gives off CO. Never use a portable gas camp stove indoors. \\nDo not use portable flameless chemical heaters indoors. Never use a generator inside your \\nhome or garage, even if doors and windows are open. Only use generators outside, more \\nthan 20 feet away from any windows, doors, and vents. When using a generator, use a \\nbattery-powered or battery backup CO detector in your home. Have a mechanic check the \\nexhaust system of your car or truck every year. A small leak in the exhaust system can lead \\nto a buildup of CO inside the car. Never run your car or truck inside a garage that is attached \\nto a house, even with the garage door open. Always open the door to a detached garage to \\nlet in fresh air when you run a car or truck inside.

The most common problems with poisonous plants arise from \\ncontact with the sap oil. Several plants native to the United States can cause an allergic skin \\nreaction. These include poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. Workers may also \\ndevelop lung irritation from contact with burning poisonous plants. Any workers who \\nspend time outside are at risk of exposure to poisonous plants. Some jobs include: \\nPoisonous plant species are found throughout the United States (except Alaska and Hawaii). \\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has maps showing the geographic location of: The old \\nsaying ?Leaves of three, let it be!? is a helpful reminder for identifying poison ivy and poison \\noak. However, it does not apply to poison sumac, which usually has clusters of 7?13 leaves. \\nIn some species, poison ivy and poison oak may also have more than three leaves. Their \\nappearance may also vary depending upon the species, the local environment, and the \\nseason. There may also be common lookalike plants in the same areas. Eastern poison ivy is \\ntypically a hairy, ropelike vine with three shiny green leaves budding from one small stem. \\nThe leaves may be red in the fall. Western poison ivy is typically a low shrub with three \\nleaves that does not form a climbing vine. It may have yellow or green flowers and white to \\ngreen-yellow or amber berries. Poison oak is typically a shrub with three leaves, like poison \\nivy. Pacific poison oak may be vine-like. It may have yellow or green flowers and clusters of \\ngreen-yellow or white berries. Poison sumac is a woody shrub that has stems with 7?13 \\nleaves arranged in pairs. It may have glossy, pale yellow, or cream-colored berries. \\nSymptoms of contact with poisonous plants include: Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison \\nsumac release an oil (urushiol) when part of the plant is damaged or burned. When the oil \\ngets on the skin, most exposed people have an allergic reaction (contact dermatitis). \\nWorkers can become exposed to urushiol through: Exposure to an amount of urushiol less \\nthan a grain of salt causes a rash in 80-90 percent of adults. The rash may significantly \\nimpede or prevent a person from working. Burning these poisonous plants can be very \\ndangerous because the allergens can irritate lungs. Employers can protect their workers \\nfrom poisonous plants by training them about: Wear long sleeves, long pants, boots, and \\ngloves. Wash exposed clothing separately in hot water with detergent. Use barrier skin \\ncreams, such as a lotion containing bentoquatam which may offer some protection before \\ncontact. Barrier creams should be washed off and reapplied twice a day. Clean tools with \\nrubbing alcohol (isopropanol or isopropyl alcohol)  or soap and lots of water. Urushiol can \\nremain active on the surface of objects for up to 5 years. Wear disposable gloves while \\ncleaning. Do not burn plants that may be poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac. Inhaling \\nsmoke from burning plants can cause severe allergic respiratory problems.

When exposure to burning poisonous plants is unavoidable, employers should \\nprovide workers with a NIOSH-certified half-face piece particulate respirator. Respirators \\nshould be rated R?95, P?95, or better. Firefighters may require a higher level of respiratory \\nprotection to protect against possible exposure to combustion products. Respirators should \\nprotect against exposure to burning poisonous plants. However, they will not protect \\nagainst all products in smoke, such as carbon monoxide. Respirators must be worn correctly \\nand consistently throughout the time they are used. For respirators to be effective there \\nmust be a tight seal between the user?s face and the respirator.

There is a chance ofside effects, but they are \\nusually mild and go away on their own. Serious reactions are also possible. Some people get \\na sore spot where the shot was given. IPV has not been known to cause serious problems, \\nand most people do not have any problems with it. Some problems that could happen after \\ngetting this vaccine: Your or your child?s doctor?s office is usually the best place to receive \\nrecommended vaccines. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, \\ncommunity health clinics, health departments, schools, or religious centers. There are a few \\nways to cover the cost of vaccines: Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. \\nHowever, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare \\nprovider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers. Your \\nchildren may be able to get no-cost vaccines through theVaccines for Children (VFC) \\nProgram. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or \\nhave access to vaccines. All 50 states and DC have state laws that require children entering \\nchildcare or public schools to have certain vaccinations. There is no federal law that \\nrequires this. CDC recommends that all children get 4 doses of IPV before or at school entry. \\nStudents in school settings have a higher likelihood of spreading chickenpox because they \\nare constantly in close contact with each other.

It comes from natural substances in some foods and in certain \\nplants, including the pits and seeds of some common fruits. Cyanide is sometimes described \\nas having a \"bitter almond\" smell. It does not always give off a smell, and not everyone can \\nsmell it. Breathing in cyanide gas causes symptoms to show up the fastest, but swallowing \\nsolid or liquid cyanide can be dangerous too. These symptoms can happen during or right \\nafter someone is exposed: If exposed to large amounts, signs and symptoms include: These \\nsymptoms can happen very quickly when exposed to a large amount of cyanide. These \\nsymptoms can happen with any type of exposure (breathing in, skin or eye contact, or \\nswallowing). If cyanide is in the water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking the \\nwater. If cyanide is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or \\nbreathing in the cyanide gas. If solid cyanide is put into water, it can make hydrogen cyanide \\ngas (HCN or AC). This can increase chances of breathing in the gas. Cyanide gas is most \\ndangerous in enclosed places where gas will be trapped. \\nCyanide gas can spread quickly in open spaces depending on the weather. less harmful \\noutdoors. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN or AC) gas is lighter than air, so the gas will rise. \\nCyanogen Chloride (CNCl or CK) is heavier and will sink to lower areas and increase the risk \\nof exposure there. Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with cyanide can expose \\npeople to cyanide. This is more likely to happen with solid cyanide. Do not use or eat food \\nthat smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have touched liquid cyanide if \\nthe food is not in a glass or metal container.

To protect all women and infants, CDC recommends the \\nfollowing: Hepatitis B Virus Infection (HBV) All pregnant women should be screened during \\neach pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history \\nof testing. Pregnant people with a history of appropriately timed triple panel screening and \\nwithout subsequent risk for exposure to HBV (i.e., no new HBV exposures since triple panel \\nscreening) only need hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening.

Hepatitis C Virus Infection (HCV) All pregnant women \\nshould be tested for hepatitis C during each pregnancy. While there is no treatment \\navailable to prevent transmission of HCV infection from mother to child, screening for HCV \\ninfection during pregnancy allows health care providers to identify infected persons who \\nshould receive treatment during the postpartum period and infants who should receive \\ntesting during a pediatric visit. Identification of HCV infection during pregnancy also can \\ninform pregnancy and delivery management issues that might reduce the risk of HCV \\ntransmission to the infant. HIV All pregnant women should be tested for HIV as early as \\npossible, preferably at the first prenatal visit. The earlier HIV is diagnosed and treated, the \\nmore effective HIV medicines ? called antiretroviral therapy or ART ? can be at preventing \\ntransmission and improving the health outcomes of both mother and child. Syphilis All \\npregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the first prenatal visit, ideally during the \\nfirst trimester of pregnancy. Among people who may be less likely to receive prenatal care, \\nconsider testing at the time of pregnancy testing. The earlier syphilis is diagnosed and \\ntreated during pregnancy, the more likely congenital syphilis and its complications (such as \\nstillbirth) can be prevented in the infant. Penicillin G is effective for preventing maternal \\ntransmission to the fetus, as well as treating fetal and maternal infection. Pregnant women \\nwho live in communities with high rates of syphilis, who are at high risk for syphilis \\nacquisition during pregnancy (e.g., substance use or a new sex partner), or who were not \\npreviously tested during the pregnancy should also be screened again at 28 weeks and at \\ndelivery. Tuberculosis (TB) Healthcare providers should assess all persons, including \\npregnant women, for risk factors associated withlatent TB infectionandTB disease. While \\nuniversal testing for latent TB infection and TB disease is not recommended for pregnant \\nwomen in the United States, targeted testing for those with risk factors, including people \\nliving with HIV infection, people born in high TB prevalence countries, and those who are \\nknown contacts of persons with TB disease, facilitates prompt initiation of curative \\ntreatment for those with TB disease.

CDC and a panel of experts who make vaccine recommendations have concluded that \\nflu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccines are not harmful for pregnant people and their babies. \\nThese experts carefully reviewed the available safety data before recommending any \\nvaccines during pregnancy. Vaccines, like medicine, can have side effects. But most people \\nwho get vaccinated have mild or no side effects.CDC continually monitors vaccine safety, \\nand the most common side effects of these vaccines include fever, tiredness, and body \\naches, as well as redness, swelling, and tenderness at the site where the shot was given. \\nYou'll need a Tdap vaccine during your pregnancy, with optimal timing between the 27th \\nthrough 36th week of each pregnancy, preferably during the earlier part of this time period. \\nTdap helps protect againstwhooping cough (pertussis), whichcan be life-threatening for \\nnewborns. About half of babies younger than 1 year old who get whooping cough need \\ntreatment in the hospital. The younger a baby is when they get whooping cough, the more \\nlikely the baby will need to be treated in a hospital. While some babies cough a lot, other \\nbabies with whooping cough don't cough at all. Instead, it can cause them to stop breathing \\nand turn blue. Siblings, parents, or caregivers who don't know they have whooping cough \\ncan infect babies since the disease often causes only mild symptoms in older children and \\nadults. Changes in your immune, heart, and lung functions during pregnancy make you \\nmore likely to get seriously ill from flu. Pregnancy increases the risk of being hospitalized \\nwith the flu and having flu-related complications if you get sick with the flu. Flu may also be \\ndangerous for your pregnancy. Fever during pregnancy, for any reason, has been associated \\nwith adverse pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, babies are more likely to get very sick from \\nflu. Flu vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older.

When \\nit comes to vaccines, timing is also important.

The preterm birth rate declined 1% from 2021 to \\n2022, to 10.4%, following an increase of 4% from 2020 to 2021. However, racial and ethnic \\ndifferences in preterm birth rates remain. In 2022, preterm birth among Black women \\n(14.6%) was about 50% higher than White (9.4%) or Hispanic women (10.1%). Important \\ngrowth happens throughout pregnancy? including in the final months and weeks. For \\nexample, the brain, lungs, and liver need the final weeks of pregnancy to fully develop. \\nUnless there is a medical need, delivery should not be scheduled before 39 weeks of \\npregnancy. Babies born too early (especially before 32 weeks) have higher rates of death \\nand disability. In2022, preterm birth and low birth weight accounted for about 14.0% of \\ninfant deaths (deaths before 1 year of age). Babies who survive may have breathing \\nproblems, feeding difficulties,cerebral palsy,developmental delay,vision problems, \\nandhearing problems. Preterm births may also take an emotional toll and be a financial \\nburden for families. Preterm labor is labor that happens too soon, before 37 weeks of \\npregnancy.

NIOSH leads a \\nnational initiative called Prevention through Design (PtD). The purpose of PtD is to promote \\nthis concept and highlight its importance in all business decisions. The PtD initiative was \\ndeveloped to support designing out hazards, the most reliable and effective type of \\nprevention. PtD encompasses all of the efforts to anticipate and design out hazards to \\nworkers in facilities, work methods and operations, processes, equipment, tools, products, \\nnew technologies, and the organization of work. The focus of PtD is on workers who execute \\nthe designs or have to work with the products of the design. The PtD National Initiative will \\nbe developed and implemented by industry sector addressing four functional \\nareas:Research, Education, Practice, and Policy. As the chart below indicates, this process \\nencourages stakeholder input through a sector-based approach consistent with the one \\nused under the National Occupational Research Agenda. The ultimate goal of the PtD \\ninitiative is to prevent or reduce occupational injuries, illnesses, and fatalities through the \\ninclusion of prevention considerations into all designs that impact workers. Along the way, \\nsub-goals will be identified to provide a path toward achieving the primary goal. NIOSH will \\nserve as a catalyst to establish this Initiative, but in the end, the partners and stakeholders \\nmust actively participate in addressing these goals to make PtD business as usual. NIOSH \\nhas released four PtD educational modules. Each module outlines the motivations for PtD, \\nencourages inclusion of worker health and safety considerations early in the design process, \\nand identifies hazards associated with the topic. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of \\n1970 established NIOSH as a research agency focused on the study of worker safety and \\nhealth, and empowering employers and workers to create safe and healthy workplaces. \\nLanguages Language Assistance \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------- \\nDisease: Preventive Health and Health Services (PHHS) Block Grant \\nURL: https://www.cdc.gov/phhs-block-grant/index.html \\nDisease Information: The Preventive Health and Health Services (PHHS) Block Grant \\nProgram (Notice of Funding Opportunity OT19-1902) provides federal funding for 61 '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 683, 'page_label': '766'}, page_content=\"recipients: all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 2 American Indian tribes, 5 US territories, \\nand 3 freely associated states.

In very rare cases,Naegleria fowlerihas been \\nfound in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and other recreational venues. \\nThe ameba also has been found in tap water. If water containing the ameba goes up the nose \\nand to the brain, it can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis \\n(PAM). Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM. Nearly everyone \\nwho gets PAM dies from it. Between 1962 and 2023, there were 164 reported cases of PAM \\nin the United States. Only four have survived. Early symptoms of PAM can include headache, \\nfever, nausea, and vomiting. PAM progresses rapidly. Most people with PAM die within 1 to \\n18 days after symptoms begin. It usually leads to coma and death after 5 days. As PAM \\nprogresses, symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and \\nsurroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations. Brain infections caused byNaegleria \\nfowleriusually occur after someone goes swimming or diving in a lake, river, or other fresh \\nwater during summer months. Infections often happen when it's been hot for long periods, \\nresulting in higher water temperatures and lower water levels. A few infections have \\noccurred when people used tap water that containedNaegleria fowlerito rinse their sinuses \\nor cleanse their nasal passages. In very rare instances, people have become infected from \\nrecreational water like splash pads and a surf park that did not have enough chlorine. You \\ncannot get aNaegleria fowleriinfection from swallowing water containing the ameba. You \\nalso can't get an infection from someone else or pass it on to others. To help protect yourself \\nagainst aNaegleria fowleriinfection: ANaegleria fowleriinfection is diagnosed using \\nlaboratory tests. These tests are available in only a few labs in the United States, including \\nCDC. Because these infections are so rare and hard to detect, diagnosis sometimes happens \\nafter a person has died. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if you or a loved one is \\nexperiencing symptoms of PAM. Naegleria fowlerican destroy brain tissue and cause the \\nbrain to swell. Unfortunately, more than 97% of people with PAM have died from the \\ninfection. PAM progresses very quickly. This has made treatments for the disease difficult to \\nidentify. There is some evidence that certain drugs may be effective.

The misfolding leads to brain damage and other symptoms. Symptoms may \\ntake years to develop. But once they do, the disease rapidly progresses and leads to death. \\nSome of the reasons people may get sick with prion diseases is eating or handling meat \\ncontaminated with prions. People may also become infected if they get prions in their \\nbodies. This may occur through organ transplant or being exposed to contaminated \\nequipment during surgery. Many different prion diseases affect people, but some are more \\ncommon than others. The most common prion disease in people is Creutzfeldt-Jakob \\ndisease (CJD). Another prion disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), has a similar \\nname but is a different, much rarer, disease. Other prion diseases include kuru, variably \\nprotease-sensitive prionopathy, sporadic fatal insomnia, and inherited forms caused by \\ngenetic mutations. CJD is a prion disease that causes a person\\'s brain to break down or stop \\nworking normally. Once symptoms start, the disease progresses quickly. It is always fatal, \\nusually within a year. CJD is sometimes called \"classic CJD\" to avoid confusion with variant \\nCJD. Most cases of classic CJD are in older people. They appear sporadically. This means '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 686, 'page_label': '769'}, page_content='there is no known reason that the cases begin. A smaller number of cases occur in people \\nwho inherited genetic changes that make them prone to CJD. Occasionally, there have also \\nbeen illnesses in people who were exposed to surgical equipment or other products \\ncontaminated with prions. vCJD is tied to eating beef from a cow that had a prion disease \\ncalled Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). It was discovered in 1996 in the United \\nKingdom. The disease affected much younger people than CJD. vCJD often infected people \\ntheir 20s or younger. It caused mental symptoms and behaviors, as well as pain when \\ntouching things (dyesthesiasis), that CJD does not. There have only been four vCJD cases \\nreported in the United States. All occurred in people who were likely exposed to BSE \\noutside the U.S. Though they have very similar names, CJD and vCJD are very different. They \\naffect different groups of people and have different causes. They have different symptoms \\nand affect the body differently. [Table goes here] There are a number of known prion \\ndiseases in animals. The two most important in the United States are bovine spongiform \\nencephalopathy (BSE) and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). BSE is a type of prion disease \\nthat affects cows. The first cases were identified in the mid-1980s, but BSE didn\\'t gain \\nwidespread attention until a major outbreak in the United Kingdom later that decade into \\nthe 1990s. Millions of cows were infected. By 2005, 24 countries had reported BSE among \\nnative cattle. (20 of the 24 were in Europe). The first BSE case in North America was \\nreported in 1993 in a cow imported into Canada from the United Kingdom. Additional BSE \\ncases were identified in Canada beginning in 2003. Later that year, a cow in Washington \\nState also tested positive. The cow had come from a Canadian farm prior to being imported \\ninto the United States and was likely exposed there. This case remains the only classic BSE \\ncase identified in the United States, although cases of atypical BSE have been found. Experts \\neventually concluded that the spread of infection in cattle was likely tied to feeding \\npractices. They speculate it began when cows were fed meat and bone meal from other \\ncows that had prion disease. CWD is a prion disease that affects animals like deer, elk, \\nmoose, and reindeer. It has been found in the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, and \\nSweden. Imported cases have also been reported in South Korea. First recognized in \\nColorado in the late 1960s, CWD has now been identified in 32 U.S. states. Though there \\nhave been no cases of CWD in people, experts think it poses a theoretical risk to people. This \\nis because CWD is related to BSE, which has caused disease in people. If CWD could spread \\nto people, hunters and people who eat meat from CWD-infected animals would likely be \\nmost at risk.

They are \\nshort and crab-like and look very different from head and body lice. Pubic lice typically \\nattach to hair in the pubic area. Adult pubic lice are 1.1?1.8 mm in length (size of a pencil \\ntip). Either over-the-counter or prescription medications can treat pubic lice infestations. \\nInfestation or infested person means that a person has lice. Signs and symptoms of pubic \\nlice include: Pubic lice do not transmit disease. However, you could get sores and a bacterial \\ninfection from intense scratching. Anyone can get pubic lice. Pubic lice usually spread \\nthrough sexual contact and are most common in adults. You usually get pubic lice from \\nintimate, person-to-person contact, usually sexual contact. Occasionally pubic lice can \\nspread by clothing, bedding, or (very rarely) using a toilet seat that was just used by a \\nperson infested with public lice. Adult pubic lice are found only on humans and require \\nblood to survive. They will die within 24 ? 48 hours without a blood meal. Female adult \\npubic lice lay about 30 eggs during their 3 ? 4-week life span. Eggs hatch after about a week. \\nNymphs (newly hatched lice) mature into adults over 6 to 9 days. Animals do not get or \\nspread pubic lice. Pubic lice found on the head or eyelashes of children may be an indication \\nof sexual exposure or abuse. The following are steps that can help prevent and control the \\nspread of pubic (\"crab\") lice: Pubic lice infestation is diagnosed by finding a \"crab\" louse or \\nnits on hair in the pubic region or, less commonly, elsewhere on the body. These areas \\ninclude the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, armpit, groin, torso, scalp, or anus. Pubic \\nlice are short and crab-like; they appear very different from head and body lice (I.e., they are \\nbroader and flatter than other lice). Although pubic lice and nits can be large enough to see \\nwith the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to see them. Lice found on the head \\ngenerally are head lice, not pubic lice. If you are unsure about infestation or if treatment is \\nnot successful, see a healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Consider getting tested for other \\nsexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You can treat pubic lice with a lice-killing lotion \\ncontaining 1% permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide. \\nThese products are available over-the-counter without a prescription at a local drug store \\nor pharmacy. These medications are safe and effective when used exactly according to the \\ninstructions in the package or on the label.

Because the blood does not \\nhave to travel very far, the pressure in this side of the heart and in the artery taking blood \\nfrom the right ventricle to the lungs is normally low?usually much lower than systolic or \\ndiastolic blood pressure. When the pressure in this artery gets too high, the arteries in the \\nlungs can narrow and then the blood does not flow as well as it should, resulting in less \\noxygen in the blood.1 The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension during the initial stage of \\nthe disease are common to many other medical conditions (e.g., difficulty breathing, \\nfatigue).

It is also called \\nthe rat lungworm. The adult form of the parasite is found only in rodents. Infected rats pass \\nlarvae of the parasite in their feces. Snails and slugs get infected by ingesting the larvae. \\nThese larvae mature in snails and slugs but do not become adult worms. The life cycle is \\ncompleted when rats eat infected snails or slugs and the larvae further mature to become \\nadult worms. Angiostrongylus cantonensis,which is also known as the rat lungworm, causes \\neosinophilic meningitis and is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands. The \\nrecognized distribution of the parasite has been increasing over time and infections have \\nbeen identified in other areas, including Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. \\nAngiostrongylus costaricensiscauses eosinophilic gastroenteritis and is found in Latin \\nAmerica and the Caribbean. Some infected people don?t have any symptoms?or have only \\nmild symptoms that don?t last very long. Sometimes the infection causes a rare type of \\nmeningitis (eosinophilic meningitis). The symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, \\ntingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting. People can get \\ninfected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite. In \\nsome cultures, snails are commonly eaten. Some children, in particular, have gotten infected \\nby swallowing snails/slugs \"on a dare. \" People also can get infected by accident, by eating \\nraw produce (such as lettuce) that contains a small snail or slug or part of one. Certain \\nanimals such freshwater shrimp, crabs, or frogs, have been found to be infected with larvae \\nof the parasite. African land snails, which can grow larger than a person?s hand, is just one \\nof many types that can be infected. But snails can be infected only if they have ingested \\ncontaminated rat feces. It is possible that eating undercooked or raw animals that are \\ninfected could result in people becoming infected, though the evidence for this is not as \\nclear as for eating infected snails and slugs. Of note, fish do not spread this parasite. This \\nvideo illustrates how people get infected withA. cantonensisor rat lungworm.  Don?t eat raw \\nor undercooked snails or slugs, frogs or shrimp/prawns. If you handle snails or slugs, wear \\ngloves and wash your hands. Always remember to thoroughly wash fresh produce. When \\ntravelling in areas where the parasite is common, avoid eating uncooked vegetables. See \\nyour healthcare provider, who will examine you and ask about any symptoms, travel, and \\nexposures you?ve had (for example, to snails/slugs). You might have some blood tests, as \\nwell as tests for meningitis. The parasite dies over time, even without treatment. Even \\npeople who develop eosinophilic meningitis usually don?t need antiparasitics. Sometimes \\nthe symptoms of the infection last for several weeks or months, while the body?s immune \\nsystem responds to the dying parasites. The most common types of treatment are for the \\nsymptoms of the infection, such as pain medication for headache or medications to reduce \\nthe body?s reaction to the parasite, rather than for the infection itself. Patients with severe \\ncases of meningitis may benefit from some other types of treatment.

Certain groups of people are more at risk for this serious and \\nsometimes deadly disease. The rodents that carry RBF include rats, mice, gerbils, guinea \\npigs, and squirrels. The bacteria that cause RBF is part of the natural germs in these \\nrodents' bodies. Rodents that are carrying the bacteria that cause RBF do not show signs of \\nillness, so it's not possible to tell if a rodent carries the bacteria just by looking at it. If you \\nknow you were bitten or scratched by a rodent, and you develop symptoms consistent with \\nRBF, you should seek medical care immediately. The infection is resistant to many \\ncommonly used antibiotics. Getting treatment with the right antibiotics is important to keep \\nthe disease from progressing. Thankfully, RBF is rare in the United States. But you should \\nknow many of these rodents that can carry it are popular pets, which can put people at risk. \\nPeople who work in pet stores or labs with rodents also could be at higher risk. The early \\nsymptoms of RBF can be like the flu. If you were infected by contact with rodents in North \\nAmerica, symptoms usually include fever, vomiting, headache, and muscle pain. About half \\nof people will also have joint pain or swelling, and 3 in 4 will develop a rash. Symptoms \\nusually begin 3 to 10 days after your contact with rodents. They can appear up to 21 days \\nafter the contact. By that time, the bite or scratch should be healed. This might make it hard \\nto remember you were bitten. Within 2 to 4 days after the fever begins, a rash may appear \\non the hands and feet. This rash looks like flat, reddened areas with small bumps. One or \\nmore joints may then become swollen, red, or painful. The bacteria that cause RBF in Asia \\ncan be different than the bacteria that causes RBF in North America. If you were infected by \\ncontact with rodents in Asia, your symptoms might be different. They can include fever, \\nswelling around the bite if you have one, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. As with the type of \\nRBF found in North America, getting early treatment is important to protecting your health. \\nComplications of RBF can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. \\nThe disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, \\nlungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. Early treatment with antibiotics is important to try \\nto prevent complications of RBF. These complications can include pockets of infected fluid \\nin the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, \\nincluding the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. These complications \\nare rare but can be very serious and even deadly. RBF can spread to people through \\nscratches, bites, or contact with a rodent's saliva or pee. It can also spread by having contact \\nwith contaminated materials (rat bedding, cages, etc.), kissing pet rats, or eating or drinking \\ncontaminated food or drinks. RBF transmission does not necessarily require contact with \\nrodents. If you have pet rodents or handle rodents as feed for snakes/reptiles, you can be at \\nincreased risk for RBF.

Reptiles \\nhave dry and scaly skin, whereas amphibians have smooth, slimy skin. Reptiles and \\namphibians are more likely than other pets to carry germs that make people sick, even \\nwhen they appear clean and healthy. The most common germ carried by reptiles and \\namphibians isSalmonella.Reptiles and amphibians often carrySalmonellabacteria in their \\ndigestive tracts. Even healthy reptiles and amphibians can carry the bacteria. People can get \\nsick fromSalmonellabacteria through contact with reptiles, amphibians, or their \\nenvironments, including water from their tanks or aquariums. If you decide that a reptile or \\namphibian is the right pet for you, it's important to learn how to properly care for your pet. \\nAppropriate husbandry and veterinary care can help keep you both safe from illness. Below \\nis a list of diseases that reptiles and amphibians can spread. Before buying or adopting a pet \\nreptile or amphibian, make sure it is the right type of pet for your family. Some reptiles can \\nlive for a very long time. Reptiles and amphibians require special care and are more likely \\nthan other pets to carry germs that make people sick, likeSalmonella, even when they \\nappear clean and healthy. Wash your handswith soap and running water: Use hand sanitizer \\nwith at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available. Supervise young \\nchildren when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol. Children younger \\nthan 5 years old should not handle or touch reptiles or amphibians or their environments \\nbecause they are at a higher risk for serious illness and hospitalization caused bySalmonella \\ninfection. You don't have to touch a reptile or amphibian to get sick from the germs they \\ncarry.

Keep reptiles, amphibians, and their equipment out of the \\nkitchen or anywhere that food is prepared, stored, served, or eaten. \\nDon't allow reptiles or amphibians to roam freely throughout a home or living area. \\nSupervise your pet when outside of its habitat to prevent accidents and contamination. Use \\na designated container for storing and thawing frozen food for your pet. Keep the pet food \\naway from human food. Wash your hands and clean the container immediately after feeding \\npet reptiles and amphibians. Frozen or live rodents used for pet food, also called feeder \\nrodents, can carry germs that can make people sick. This can happen even if the rodent \\nlooks healthy and clean. Freezing feeder rodents does not kill germs. Always wash your \\nhands after handling live or frozen rodents or touching anything they came in contact with. \\nClean and disinfect all surfaces and supplies that come in contact with rodents. Rodents can \\ncontaminate surfaces where they are thawed or anything they touch. You can get sick by \\ntouching contaminated surfaces; you don't have to touch the rodents to get sick from their \\ngerms. Keep rodents and their supplies out of the kitchen or other areas where food is \\nprepared, served, or consumed. Never use the kitchen sink or food preparation areas to \\nthaw frozen rodents or to clean live rodent habitats. Do not thaw frozen rodents in the \\nmicrowave. Clean rodent supplies outside your home when possible. If you clean rodent \\nsupplies indoors, use a laundry sink or bathtub, and thoroughly clean and disinfect the area \\nright after. \\nUse frozen rodents when possible to reduce the risk of injury to your or your pet. Never \\nfeed your pets wild rodents. Animal supplies such as tanks, feeders, water containers, and \\nother pet equipment or materials should be cleaned outside the home if possible. \\nNever use food preparation areas to clean reptile and amphibian habitats or equipment. If \\nyou clean supplies outside, do so away from gardens or other sources of food or drinking \\nwater.

Not all reptiles and amphibians have teeth, but even those who \\ndon't (like most turtles) can still have painful bites. Bites from reptiles and amphibians can \\nbe dangerous because they can spread germs and sometimes other toxic substances, \\ndepending on the type of animal. Bites and scratches can be serious injuries and sometimes \\ncan become infected. Don't kiss or hold reptiles or amphibians close to your face, as this \\nmight frighten them and increase your chances of being bitten. Make sure the animal sees \\nyou before you pick it up. If an animal is surprised, they might bite out of fear. Feed your \\nreptile with tongs. Don't give them food from your hand. \\nHandle your pet often so they become used to being held. If you only handle your pet to feed \\nthem, they might learn to associate a hand with food.

If you develop rhabdo, you might have 1 or \\nmore of these symptoms: You can?t tell by symptoms alone if you have rhabdo. The only \\nway to know for sure is to see a healthcare provider. They can order blood tests for creatine \\nkinase (CK), a marker for muscle damage. You need repeated tests to see if CK levels are \\nrising or falling. If you have any of these symptoms at any time, do not ignore them. Seek \\nmedical treatment right away. Earlier diagnosis means an earlier start to treatment and a \\ngreater chance of recovery without permanent health effects. Anyone can get rhabdo, but \\nsome workers are at a higher risk than others. There are also non-work-related factors that \\ncan increase your risk. This includes some medical conditions, behaviors, and use of certain \\nmedications. Workers and employers can take action to lower workers' risk of rhabdo. \\nSome important steps include: Early treatmentcan prevent serious medical problems. It also \\nincreases your chances of a quick recovery and return to work without any lasting negative \\nhealth effects. Workers with symptoms of rhabdo should: If heat stroke is suspected, follow \\nthesefirst aid steps. It?s a common misconception that only unfit or out of shape people get \\nrhabdo. People in great shape, such as firefighters, marathon runners, and professional \\nathletes, get rhabdo. It can happen to anyone and even after activities you have done in the \\npast without a problem. People also falsely believe dehydration causes rhabdo. Dehydration \\ndoesn't cause rhabdo but it can make it worse. Dehydration impairs the body's ability to get \\nrid of the proteins and electrolytes in the blood stream released from damaged muscle. \\nThese proteins and electrolytes cause organ damage. Other heat-related conditions, like \\nheat exhaustion and heat cramps, can cause similar symptoms. Learn more aboutheat-\\nrelated illnesses. Compartment syndrome is a painful condition also caused by muscle \\ndamage. Some muscles are grouped together inside a thin, fibrous sheath or covering. \\nSwelling from muscle damage inside the sheath can cause pressure to build, because the \\nsheath cannot stretch very far. This swelling and pressure can prevent blood flow to \\nmuscles, causing the muscle to die. Compartment syndrome is not common, but it is \\nimportant to getimmediate medical treatment. Delayed treatment can causepermanent \\ndisability. See the NIOSHTIC-2 database search results onrhabdo.

If castor beans are \\nchewed and swallowed, the ricin that comes out can cause injury. Ricin can be made from \\nthe waste material left over from processing castor beans. Ricin can be in the form of a \\npowder, a mist, or a pellet. It can also be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is stable under \\nnormal conditions. However, it will not work if temperatures are over 80 degrees \\ncentigrade (176 degrees Fahrenheit). Castor beans are processed throughout the world to \\nmake castor oil. Ricin is part of the waste \"mash\" produced when castor oil is made. Ricin \\nhas been used in experiments in medicine to kill cancer cells. In the 1940s, the U.S. military \\nexperimented with using ricin as a possible warfare agent. In some reports, ricin has \\npossibly been used as a warfare agent in the 1980s in Iraq. It is also that ricin has been used \\nmore recently by terrorist organizations. Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a \\nperson\\'s body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need. Without the \\nproteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur. The \\nmajor symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on how much ricin someone was exposed to and \\nhow they were exposed. Many organs may be affected in severe cases. Death could happen \\nwithin 36 to 72, depending on how much ricin someone was exposed to and how they were \\nexposed. Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was breathed in, swallowed, or \\ninjected. First symptoms of ricin poisoning by breathing in may occur as early as 4 to 8 \\nhours. It may occur as late as 24 hours after exposure. Within a few hours, the following \\nmay occur: Eventually symptoms may worsen into: All of these symptoms can lead to death. \\nIf you know you have been exposed to ricin and have trouble breathing,seek medical care. If \\nricin is swallowed, first symptoms usually occur in less than 10 hours. Symptoms include: '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 723, 'page_label': '806'}, page_content=\"Other signs or symptoms may include: These symptoms can lead to death. Ricin is unlikely \\nto be absorbed (taken in) through normal skin. Touching ricin powders or products may \\ncause redness and pain on the skin and the eyes. Ricin poisoning is not contagious and \\naccidental exposure is not likely. However, castor beans and ricin can be swallowed. You \\ncan also be exposed if you come into contact with someone who has ricin on their body or \\nclothes. Ricin could be made into a partially purified material or into a terrorist or warfare \\nagent. If that happens, ricin could be used to expose people through the air, food, or water. \\nIn 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who lived in London, died from \\nricin poisoning. He was attacked by a man with an umbrella. The umbrella was made to \\ninject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin. Get fresh air by leaving the area where the \\nricin is. If ricin was released outside, move away from the area. If ricin was released indoors, \\nget out of the building. Take off the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of \\npulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas. Wash any \\nricin from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect \\nyou from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, \\nrinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them \\nand put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they \\nare not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You \\ncan put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. After you have washed yourself, place \\nyour clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't \\navoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber \\ngloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in \\nthe bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you \\nwear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside \\nanother plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others \\nfrom any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When the local or state health \\ndepartment or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health \\ndepartment or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic \\nbags yourself. A clue of ricin poisoning is when lots of people who were close to each other \\nhave the same symptoms. If authorities think ricin may have been spread, they will perform \\nenvironmental tests. These tests will find ricin in powders or materials that are let out into \\nthe environment. People who live in these areas may also be looked at for signs of ricin \\npoisoning. The CDC can temporarily test samples for urinary ricinine. Urinary ricinine is an \\nalkaloid (natural compounds with nitrogen) in the castor bean plant. Only urinary ricinine \\ntesting is available at CDC or theLaboratory Response Network(LRN). No cure exists for \\nricin. The most important thing to do is avoid ricin exposure in the first place. \\nIf you cannot avoid exposure, get the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible. \\nPatients showing symptoms of ricin poisoning are treated by giving patients supportive \\nmedical care to lower the effects of the poisoning.

The effects usually only last 15 to 30 \\nminutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off. The level of poisoning \\ndepends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how \\nlong. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors). People exposed \\nto riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately \\nafter exposure: Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects \\nsuch as: Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has \\nbeen exposed to riot control agents. Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or \\nsolids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets \\nor particles. If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin \\ncontact, eye contact, or breathing them in. Since breathing in riot control agents is the \\nprimary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where \\nfresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents. If the riot \\ncontrol agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were \\nreleased. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the \\nhighest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel \\nclose to the ground. If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building. \\nIf you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you toevacuate the areaor \"shelter in \\nplace\" inside. Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it \\nover the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas. Wash any riot control \\nagents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will \\nprotect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is \\nblurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove \\nthem and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if \\nthey are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. \\nYou can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. After you have washed yourself, \\nplace your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you \\ncan\\'t avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren\\'t sure where the unsafe areas are, wear \\nrubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the \\nclothing in the bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. \\nIf you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. Seal or tie the bag, and then put that \\nbag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and \\nothers from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When the local or state health \\ndepartment or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health \\ndepartment or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic \\nbags yourself. Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her \\nblood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. \\nOnce they infect a person, they can cause diseases that attack different parts of the body. \\nSymptoms of filarial worm infections range from itching and swelling to disfigurement and \\nblindness. However, many people infected with filarial worms will have no symptoms. \\nDiseases and common symptoms caused by filarial worms include Filarial worm diseases \\naffect millions of people a year in Africa, South America, the Pacific islands, and Asia. They \\nspread mostly through the bites of insects like blackflies, mosquitoes, or midges. Tiny \\nimmature worms, known as larvae, will enter a human body when the insect bites into the \\nskin. Once inside a person, they spread throughout the body, grow, and reproduce. When an \\ninsect bites an infected person, the insect can ingest the new larvae and eventually infect \\nanother person. In most cases, the best way to prevent most filarial worm infections is \\ntoavoid insect bites. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, using insect repellent on \\nexposed skin, and sleeping under mosquito nets will help prevent insects from biting you. \\nMedications known as antiparasitic drugs can treat new filarial worm infections. In people \\nwith advanced disease-causing chronic swelling, surgery or lymphedema care may be \\nneeded. Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are currently the target of mass drug \\nadministration (MDA) campaigns. These campaigns deliver safe and inexpensive drugs \\naimed at reducing or eliminating transmission of these infections. For some, filaria MDA will \\nreduce symptoms as well. For others, other treatments are needed for symptoms. Filarial \\nworms include loa loa, lymphatic filariasis, mansonella, and onchocerciasis infections. \\nLanguages Language Assistance \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------- \\nDisease: Robotics in the Workplace \\nURL: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/robotics/about/index.html \\nDisease Information: Robots have existed in the workplace for many years, but their \\nnumbers and capabilities are quickly growing.

Certain groups of people are more at risk for this serious and \\nsometimes deadly disease. The rodents that carry RBF include rats, mice, gerbils, guinea \\npigs, and squirrels. The bacteria that cause RBF is part of the natural germs in these \\nrodents' bodies. Rodents that are carrying the bacteria that cause RBF do not show signs of \\nillness, so it's not possible to tell if a rodent carries the bacteria just by looking at it. If you \\nknow you were bitten or scratched by a rodent, and you develop symptoms consistent with \\nRBF, you should seek medical care immediately. The infection is resistant to many \\ncommonly used antibiotics. Getting treatment with the right antibiotics is important to keep \\nthe disease from progressing. Thankfully, RBF is rare in the United States. But you should \\nknow many of these rodents that can carry it are popular pets, which can put people at risk. \\nPeople who work in pet stores or labs with rodents also could be at higher risk. The early \\nsymptoms of RBF can be like the flu. If you were infected by contact with rodents in North \\nAmerica, symptoms usually include fever, vomiting, headache, and muscle pain. About half \\nof people will also have joint pain or swelling, and 3 in 4 will develop a rash. Symptoms \\nusually begin 3 to 10 days after your contact with rodents. They can appear up to 21 days \\nafter the contact. By that time, the bite or scratch should be healed. This might make it hard \\nto remember you were bitten. Within 2 to 4 days after the fever begins, a rash may appear \\non the hands and feet. This rash looks like flat, reddened areas with small bumps. One or \\nmore joints may then become swollen, red, or painful. The bacteria that cause RBF in Asia \\ncan be different than the bacteria that causes RBF in North America. If you were infected by \\ncontact with rodents in Asia, your symptoms might be different. They can include fever, \\nswelling around the bite if you have one, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. As with the type of \\nRBF found in North America, getting early treatment is important to protecting your health. \\nComplications of RBF can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. \\nThe disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, \\nlungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. Early treatment with antibiotics is important to try \\nto prevent complications of RBF. These complications can include pockets of infected fluid \\nin the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, \\nincluding the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. These complications \\nare rare but can be very serious and even deadly. RBF can spread to people through \\nscratches, bites, or contact with a rodent's saliva or pee. It can also spread by having contact \\nwith contaminated materials (rat bedding, cages, etc.), kissing pet rats, or eating or drinking \\ncontaminated food or drinks. RBF transmission does not necessarily require contact with \\nrodents. If you have pet rodents or handle rodents as feed for snakes/reptiles, you can be at \\nincreased risk for RBF. Other at risk include people who work at pet stores or laboratories \\nwhere they may have contact with rodents. Although rare, some animals like dogs, cats, \\nferrets, and rabbits can be infected by contact with infected rodents and then pass the \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 732, 'page_label': '815'}, page_content=\"infection on to people.

Part G of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 requires \\nthat medical facilities provide EREs with notification of when they may have been \\nexposedCto potentially life-threatening infectious diseases while transporting or serving \\nvictims of an emergency. Knowing this information allows EREs the opportunity to seek \\ntimely medical care and to make informed decisions about addressing potential health \\nissues arising from their exposures. NIOSH has developed a list of potentially life-\\nthreatening diseases, including emerging infectious diseases, to which EREs may be \\nexposed while transporting or serving emergency victims taken to a medical facility. Along \\nwith the list, NIOSH has also developed guidelines describing circumstances in which EREs \\nmay be exposed to a listed disease and the manner in which a determination of an exposure \\nshall be made by a medical facility. Medical facilities that receive and treat the victims of an \\nemergency or ascertain the cause of death are responsible for routinely notifying and \\nresponding to requests pertaining to any determinations that a victim of an emergency has \\na listed potentially life-threatening infectious disease, as described in the NIOSH guidelines. \\nWhen a medical facility determines that a victim of an emergency has a potentially life-\\nthreateningairborneoraerosolizedinfectious disease, the medical facility is responsible for \\ninitiating notification to the ERE who transported the victim.

Water is the essence of life and human dignity. Sufficient, \\nsafe, physically accessible, and affordable water is vital for all. Despite great strides over the \\nlast decades, 1.1 billion people living in rural areas and urban slums still rely on \\nunsafedrinking waterfrom rivers, lakes, and open wells. Children suffer greatly from water-\\nrelated illnesses. Every year, nearly 2 million children die from the consequences of \\ndiarrhea and other diseases such ascholera,typhoid, anddysentery. CDC works with many \\nglobal partners to develop and distribute simple and inexpensive disinfection and filtration \\nsystems that make an immediate difference in the lives of the worst affected. On another \\nfront: in collaboration with The Carter Center, CDC has worked to develop strategies \\ntoeradicate Guinea worm diseasefrom sub-Saharan Africa. This water-borneparasitic \\ndiseaseis about to be conquered?a global public health achievement. TheCDC Safe Water \\nSystemis a very simple solution to a very big problem. In response to a1991 cholera \\nepidemic in Peru, CDC scientists designed a way for families to treat unsafe water. A diluted \\nhypochlorite (bleach) solution was used to treat water in specially designed vessels to \\nprotect the treated water from recontamination during transport, storage, and handling in \\nthe household. The solution and water vessels both had to be products that families would \\nbe willing to use, and education to improve hygiene and water handling practices was \\ncritical. Promising pilot studies in Bolivia led to partnerships with Proctor & Gamble and \\nPopulation Services International, a non-governmental organization. In 1996, the first \\nnational Safe Water System program-called CLARO was launched in Bolivia. CDC Safe Water \\nSystem programs are now running in 24 countries around the world ? from Afghanistan to \\nZambia. Partners range from international organizations such as UNICEF to local non-\\ngovernmental agencies to Ministries of Water and Education to manufacturers, both local \\nand multinational. In many developing countries in Africa and South America, people re-\\npurpose 20-liter (5-gallon) jerry cans, initially used for cooking oil, to transport and store \\nwater. They are easy to carry on the head and are a good option for safe water storage. The \\nopening is too small to allow hands or utensils into the water, so the water is poured out \\nwithout contamination. The jerry cans can also be modified by drilling a hole in the plastic \\nand adding a tap to provide water that has been treated for drinking or handwashing. Based \\non the popularity of jerry cans, CDC worked with Proctor & Gamble to design what is known \\ninternationally as the ?CDC SWS Modified Jerry Can.? On display is the original cream-\\ncolored prototype, which includes indentations on the flat sides so that the container can be \\ncarried more comfortably on the head. The green and blue examples are from Bolivia and \\nGuatemala.  CDC works with SWAP, a non-governmental agency based in Kisimu, Kenya, to \\nprovide HIV support groups, opportunities to promote and sell water treatment and other \\nhealth products, and to provide HIV services. Other initiatives integrate safe water \\nprograms with infant care and immunization programs as incentives for mothers to come in \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 739, 'page_label': '822'}, page_content='for care, and to begin adopting healthy behaviors. When Haiti was struck by a massive \\nearthquake in 2010, Safe Water System programs and other point-of-use treatments had \\nbeen in use in Haiti for over 15 years. Five-gallon plastic buckets adapted with spigots, like \\nthe one on display here, were already the most-used Haitian water storage containers. \\nThese buckets and solutions are examples of products distributed immediately after the \\nearthquake by CDC and other partners. Late in 2010, when Haiti experienced its \\nfirstcholeraepidemic, these products were widely distributed to affected populations. CDC?s \\ngoal is to promote sustainable, long-term drinking water programs that will help prevent \\ndisease and improve health. Long-term programs require many partners (both \\ngovernmental and non-governmental), community will, and long-term strategies for how to \\nmanufacture and distribute SWS products. Some of the most successful programs in \\ncountries such as Bolivia and Kenya contribute significantly to local economies by providing \\njobs to health educators, distributors, and manufacturers. To encourage communities to \\ntreat household drinking water through the Safe Water System, health educators draw upon \\nvarious behavior change techniques, including social marketing, community mobilization, \\nhealth education, and promotion. Organized community-by-community, education \\ncampaigns show the link between contaminated water and disease, as well as the benefits of \\nsafe water and hygienic behaviors. Because fecal contamination from poor sanitation \\npractices and unwashed hands and foods can spread disease, these campaigns also promote \\nhand-washing and proper latrine use. The Safe Water System (SWS) works best in \\ncommunities where families have enough water for their daily needs. Each community faces \\ndifferent challenges. It is critical to understand the sources of water; how it is collected, \\ntransported, and stored; as well as local sanitation, cultural, and economic practices. \\nSuccessful programs start with community will and buy-in, often coupled with technical and \\nfinancial assistance from governments, non-governmental agencies, and industries. For a \\nSafe Water System (SWS) to have a health impact, households must obtain and correctly use \\nthe disinfectant on an ongoing basis. Although there is significant debate about pricing of \\nhealth products for people in developing countries, it is generally accepted that users who \\npay something for a product?even a minimal amount?are more likely to value the product, \\nuse it correctly, and continue to use it. Social marketing uses commercial marketing \\nmethods, such as branding and consumer research, to increase the acceptability of a \\nproduct to meet a social need. Products are subsidized to some degree depending upon the \\ncapacity of a community or country and the amount of donor support available. Many SWS \\nprojects have used social marketing strategies, including advertising, community events \\nsuch as parades and skits, and T-shirt giveaways. People living in poor, remote rural areas \\nwithout safe water have long suffered the burning pain ofGuinea worm \\ndisease(dracunculiasis), caused by the ?fiery serpent,?Dracunculus medinensis. There is no \\ndrug treatment or vaccine to prevent it. People become infected with Guinea worm when \\nthey drink water containing copepods (water fleas) that have eaten Guinea worm larvae. \\nThe wormsmature and grow inside the human body?some as long as 3 feet. After a year, the \\nfemale worm slowly emerges through painful blisters in the skin. People seeking relief from \\nthe burning sensation caused by the emerging Guinea worm immerse their affected limbs in \\ndrinking water sources. This stimulates the worm to release larvae into the water, and the '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 740, 'page_label': '823'}, page_content='contamination cycle begins again. Using simple filters, treating contaminated water sources, \\nand digging safe wells can prevent the disease. Aglobal partnershipof public, private, and \\ngovernmental organizations has set the goal of making Guinea worm disease disappear \\nfrom the planet. In 1986, about 3.5 million persons in at least 21 countries in Asia, Africa, \\nand the Middle East had the disease. Today, the number of cases is down to only a few per \\nyear in a few African countries.

Today, millions of people \\naround the world do not have clean water to drink, and billions do not have a safe place to \\ngo to the bathroom. This can lead to serious illnesses like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea, \\nwhich are especially dangerous for infants and children. Access to clean water, sanitation, \\nand hygiene remains a significant global challenge, withover 2 billion peoplelacking clean \\ndrinking water at home,1.5 billion lacking basic sanitation facilities, and2 billion lacking \\nbasic hygiene services. Universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene has \\nthe potential to greatly reduce global disease burden. Investing in water and sanitation \\ninterventions brings economic, environmental, quality of life, and health benefits. WASH \\nalso plays a key role in improving nutritional outcomes, particularly among children. Unsafe \\nwater, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene play a major role in spreading diseases \\nlikecholeraandtyphoid fever. These conditions also contribute to the emergence of more \\ndangerous forms of diseases, such as extensively drug-resistant typhoid fever. Addressing \\nthese challenges requires dedicated efforts to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene \\n(WASH) practices. These improvements are necessary for preventing the spread of disease \\nand dealing with emerging threats like antibiotic-resistant infections. Harmful germs, \\nparasites, or toxic chemicals can contaminate water. This contaminated water comes from \\nhuman or animal waste, pesticides, and industrial waste. This can make people sick with \\ndiseases like cholera, typhoid, polio, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of \\ndeath in children under five years old. The primary risk factors for diarrhea include unsafe \\nwater and sanitation, along with childhood malnutrition. In addition, not having access to \\nclean water, toilets, and good hygiene practices makes it harder to stop and manage \\nneglected tropical diseases likeschistosomiasis,trachoma, andGuinea worm disease. This \\nkeeps the cycle of poverty and sickness going. Having reliable access to safe water, proper \\nsanitation, and good hygiene practices significantly reduces the burden of disease globally. \\nKey facts highlight the impact of these conditions: Improving WASH infrastructure and \\npractices is key to breaking the cycle of disease and poverty and highlights the need for \\nglobal efforts to ensure everyone has access to safe water and sanitation.

However, a person with an infestation can transmit \\nscabies even if they do not have symptoms. To prevent scabies, avoid direct skin-to-skin \\ncontact with a person who has scabies. Avoid sharing items such as clothing or bedding \\nused by a person who has scabies. To control the spread of scabies, treat all household \\nmembers and close contacts at the same time as the person with scabies. This should help to \\nprevent possible re-exposure and reinfestation. Wash all clothing, towels, and bedding used \\nnext to the skin during the three days before starting treatment. Items should be machine \\nwashed using hot water (temperatures in excess of 50°C or 122°F for 10 minutes will kill \\nmites and eggs), dried on the hot cycle, or dry-cleaned. Seal items you can't wash or dry-\\nclean in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not \\nsurvive more than two to three days away from human skin. Children and adults can usually \\nreturn to childcare, school, or work the day after treatment. Your healthcare professional \\ncan sometimes diagnose scabies based on physical exam findings and history but will likely \\ntry to confirm scabies by finding the mite, mite eggs, or feces (scybala). They may scrape \\nyour skin or use the tip of a needle to carefully remove the mite from the end of its burrow. \\nThe sample is examined under a microscope to confirm scabies. A person can still have \\nscabies even if mites, eggs, or feces are not found. Fewer than 10 ? 15 mites may be present \\non an infected person who is otherwise healthy.

It is one of the most toxic and fast acting nerve agents. Nerve agents \\nstop certain enzymes from working. When this enzyme does not work correctly, muscles \\nare constantly being used. As a result, people may become tired and no longer be able to \\nkeep breathing. Sarin is a clear, colorless, tasteless liquid with no smell. \\nSarin can evaporate into a vapor (gas) and spread into the environment. Signs and \\nsymptoms depend on the amount of sarin, how the person was exposed, and for how long. \\nSarin has no smell, so people may not know they were exposed until signs and symptoms \\ndevelop. Exposure to a low or medium amount may cause some or all of these signs and \\nsymptoms within seconds to hours: Even a small drop of sarin on the skin can cause \\nsweating and muscle twitching where it touched the skin. Exposure to large doses of sarin \\nby any type of exposure would likely cause the following harmful health effects: If sarin is in \\nthe air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the sarin gas. \\nBecause sarin vapor is heavier than air, it will sink to low-lying areas and increase the risk \\nof exposure there. Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with sarin can expose people \\nto sarin. Avoid using or eating food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that \\nmay have touched sarin if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an \\nunbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by sarin. Wash the \\noutside of the container before using. If sarin is in water, people can be exposed by touching \\nor drinking the water. Sarin mixes easily with water, which helps it spread. People can also \\nbe exposed to liquid sarin by swallowing it, getting it on their skin, or in their eyes. People \\ncan also touch or breathe in sarin gas from clothes that has been exposed to sarin. Follow \\nany directions by local authorities. Get away from the area where the sarin was released \\nand breathe fresh air. If the sarin release was outdoors, go indoors andshelter in place. \\nMake sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the sarin \\ndoes not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the sarin was released. \\nIf you cannot get away from the area, go to the highest ground possible. Sarin is heavier \\nthan air and will sink to lower areas.

Places where scabies outbreaks more commonly occur include: You can \\nget scabies by When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms \\ntypically take 4 ? 8 weeks to develop. However, a person with an infestation can transmit \\nscabies even if they do not have symptoms. To prevent scabies, avoid direct skin-to-skin \\ncontact with a person who has scabies. Avoid sharing items such as clothing or bedding \\nused by a person who has scabies. To control the spread of scabies, treat all household \\nmembers and close contacts at the same time as the person with scabies. This should help to \\nprevent possible re-exposure and reinfestation. Wash all clothing, towels, and bedding used \\nnext to the skin during the three days before starting treatment. Items should be machine \\nwashed using hot water (temperatures in excess of 50°C or 122°F for 10 minutes will kill \\nmites and eggs), dried on the hot cycle, or dry-cleaned. Seal items you can't wash or dry-\\nclean in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not \\nsurvive more than two to three days away from human skin. Children and adults can usually \\nreturn to childcare, school, or work the day after treatment. Your healthcare professional \\ncan sometimes diagnose scabies based on physical exam findings and history but will likely \\ntry to confirm scabies by finding the mite, mite eggs, or feces (scybala). They may scrape \\nyour skin or use the tip of a needle to carefully remove the mite from the end of its burrow. \\nThe sample is examined under a microscope to confirm scabies. A person can still have \\nscabies even if mites, eggs, or feces are not found. Fewer than 10 ? 15 mites may be present \\non an infected person who is otherwise healthy. The first time a person gets scabies they \\nusually have no symptoms at the beginning. Symptoms can take four to eight weeks to \\ndevelop after infestation; however, people can still spread scabies during this time. If you \\nsuspect you have scabies, seek medical attention. Your healthcare professional can \\nprescribe a cream, lotion, or pill that kills scabies mites. To prevent the spread of scabies \\nScabies mites generally do not survive more than two to three days away from human skin. \\nProducts used to treat scabies (scabicides) kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. \\nScabicides require a doctor's prescription. No non-prescription products have been tested \\nand approved to treat scabies. Carefully follow the instructions contained in the box or on \\nthe label. Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck \\ndown to the feet and toes. For infants and children, the lotion or cream should be applied to \\ntheir entire head and neck as well as the rest of the body. Only permethrin or sulfur \\nointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and \\nleft on for the recommended time before washing it off. The itching of scabies is due to a \\nhypersensitivity reaction (allergy) to mites and their feces, so itching may continue for \\nseveral weeks after treatment even if all the mites and eggs are killed. However, if itching \\nstill is present two to four weeks after treatment or if new burrows or pimple-like rash \\nappear, retreatment may be necessary.

Human trafficking occurs when a trafficker exploits \\nan individual with force, fraud, or coercion to  perform commercial sex acts or work. Sex \\ntrafficking is defined by theTrafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000as \"the recruitment, \\nharboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the \\npurpose of a commercial sex act.\" It involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to make an \\nadult engage in commercial sex acts.

Survivors may be \\nashamed, embarrassed, or afraid to tell the police, friends, or family about the violence. \\nVictims may also keep quiet because they have been threatened or do not think anyone will \\nhelp them. Sexual violence is common: Sexual violence starts early: Some groups are \\naffected more than others. Women and racial and ethnic minority groups experience a \\nhigher burden of sexual violence.2345678For example, more than two in five non-Hispanic \\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native and non-Hispanic multiracial women were raped in their \\nlifetime.2 Sexual violence is also costly. Recent estimates put the lifetime cost of rape at \\n$122,461 per survivor, including medical care, lost productivity from work, and criminal \\njustice costs.9 Some consequences are physical, like bruising and genital injuries, sexually \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 757, 'page_label': '840'}, page_content=\"transmitted infections, and pregnancy (for women). Some consequences are psychological, \\nsuch as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.10 The consequences may be chronic. \\nSurvivors may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and experience recurring \\nreproductive, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and sexual health problems.10 Sexual \\nviolence is also linked to negative health behaviors. Sexual violence survivors are more \\nlikely to smoke, abuse alcohol, use drugs, and engage in risky sexual activity.11 The trauma \\nfrom sexual violence may impact a survivor's employment. This refers to time off from \\nwork, diminished performance, job loss, or inability to work. These issues disrupt earning \\npower and have a long-term effect on the economic well-being of survivors and their \\nfamilies. Coping and completing everyday tasks after victimization can be challenging. \\nSurvivors may have difficulty maintaining personal relationships, returning to work or \\nschool, and regaining a sense of normalcy.10 Sexual violence is also connected to other \\nforms of violence. For example, girls who have been sexually abused are more likely to \\nexperience additional sexual violence. They are also more likely to become victims of \\nintimate partner violence in adulthood.12Bullying perpetration in early middle school is \\nlinked to sexual harassment perpetration in high school.13 Sexual violence can be \\nprevented.Certain factors my increase or decrease the riskof perpetrating or experiencing \\nsexual violence. Preventing sexual violencerequires understanding and addressing the \\nfactors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence.12We must also understand \\nhow historical trauma and structural inequalities impact health.2 Changing social norms, \\nteaching skills, empowering girls and women, and creating protective environments can \\nhelp prevent and reduce sexual violence.14We all have a role to play in prevention.

People get shingles \\nwhen the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes chickenpox, reactivates in their bodies \\nafter they have already had chickenpox. An estimated 1 million people get shingles each \\nyear in this country. Most people who develop shingles only have it one time during their \\nlife. However, you can have shingles more than once. People with shingles most commonly \\nhave a rash around the left or right side of the body. The rash is usually painful, itchy, or \\ntingly. Shingles can lead to serious complications. The most common shingles complication \\nis long-term nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN. You have had chickenpox. \\nMore than 99%of Americans born before 1980 had chickenpox, even if they don't \\nremember it. Children can have shingles, but it is not common. Your risk of shingles and \\nserious complications increases: Youcannotget shingles from someone who has shingles. \\nYoucanget chickenpox from someone who has shingles if you never had chickenpox or \\nnever got chickenpox vaccine. You could then develop shingles later in life. Shingles is \\ncaused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. Once a \\nperson has chickenpox, the virus stays in their body. The virus can reactivate later in life \\nand cause shingles. People who never had chickenpox or didn't get chickenpox vaccine can \\nget infected with VZV from someone who has shingles. These people can get the virus \\nthrough: People with chickenpox are more likely to spread VZV than people with shingles. \\nProtect yourself with the vaccine.CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine \\n(RZV, Shingrix) to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. \\nShingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune \\nsystems because of disease or therapy. Covering the shingles rash can lower the risk of \\nspreading the shingles virus to others. People with shingles cannot spread the virus before \\nthe blisters appear or after the rash scabs over. To prevent spreading the virus to others: \\nSeveral antiviral medicines are available to treat shingles: These medicines shorten the \\nlength and severity of the illness. They work best when you take them as soon as the rash \\nappears. If you think you have shingles, contact your doctor as soon as possible to talk about \\ntreatment. Pain relief medicine may help with the pain caused by shingles. This can be over \\nthe counter or a prescription from your doctor. Wet compresses, calamine lotion, and warm \\noatmeal baths may help relieve itching. Shingles is a painful rash illness caused by the \\nvaricella-zoster virus (VZV).

In regard to small \\nbusinesses The definition of a ?small? business varies widely, particularly as it relates to \\nworkplace safety and health. The characteristics that distinguish a smaller business from a \\nlarger one in terms of occupational safety and health include not only number of employees \\nbut also the structure (including sole proprietorships), the age of the business (most new \\nbusinesses are small), and a manager-centered culture (the owner/operator sets the culture \\nof the business). Despite the stereotype of a small business as a small town retail or service \\nfirm, some smaller businesses do not fit the stereotype, e.g., high-tech manufacturing \\nstartups. For most occupational safety and health research purposes, the NIOSH Small \\nBusiness Assistance Program considers small businesses as having fewer than 50 \\nemployees. This number is consistent with European Union criteria for defining small \\nenterprises, as well as the Affordable Care Act cutoff for requiring employers to provide \\nhealth insurance to employees. Small Businesses struggle to exist in a risky economic \\nenvironment. Market forces, structural changes, and emerging social and business climate \\nthreats may affect levels of resources available for occupational safety and health initiatives \\nfor small businesses. While two-thirds of new small businesses survive at least 2 years, only \\n44% survive at least 4 years. These numbers are consistent across sectors. One research \\nteam found that businesses that lasted five years had less than half the annual workplace \\ninjury rate as businesses that lasted only two years.

They are the conditions in which people \\nare born, grow, work, live, worship, and age. These conditions include a wide set of forces \\nand systems that shape daily life such as economic policies and systems, development \\nagendas, social norms, social policies, and political systems. CDC has adapted this definition \\nfrom the World Health Organization. SDOH are one of three priority areas forHealthy People \\n2030, along with health equity and health literacy. Healthy People 2030 sets data-driven \\nnational objectives infive key areas of SDOH: healthcare access and quality, education access \\nand quality, social and community context, economic stability, and neighborhood and built \\nenvironment. Some examples of SDOH included in Healthy People 2030 are safe housing, \\ntransportation, and neighborhoods; polluted air and water; and access to nutritious foods \\nand physical health opportunities. As the federal government's leading public health agency, \\nCDC has a unique role in contributing to work on SDOH. Addressing differences in SDOH \\naccelerates progress towardhealth equity, a state in which every person has the opportunity \\nto attain their highest level of health. SDOH have been shown to have a greater influence on \\nhealth than either genetic factors or access to healthcare services. For example, poverty is \\nhighly correlated with poorer health outcomes and higher risk of premature death.ASDOH, \\nincluding the effects of centuries of racism, are key drivers of health inequities within \\ncommunities of color. The impact is pervasive and deeply embedded in our society, creating \\ninequities in access to a range of social and economic benefits?such as housing, education, \\nwealth, and employment. These inequities put people at higher risk of poor health. CDC is \\ncoordinating efforts to focus its resources on the areas where federal public health \\ninvestments can make the most difference.

When it is mixed with water or an acid, sodium azide changes quickly \\nto a toxic gas with a sharp smell. It also changes into a toxic gas (hydrazoic acid) when it \\ncomes in contact with solid metals. For example, when it is poured into a drain pipe \\ncontaining lead or copper. The smell of the gas may not be sharp enough to give people a \\ngood enough warning of the danger. Sodium azide is best known as the chemical found in \\nautomobile airbags. The automobile impact causes an electrical charge which makes sodium \\nazide explode and change to nitrogen gas inside the airbag. Sodium azide is used as a \\nchemical preservative (product that makes things last longer) in hospitals and laboratories. \\nAccidents have occurred in these settings. In one case, sodium azide was poured into a \\ndrain, where it exploded and the toxic gas was inhaled (breathed in). Sodium azide is used \\nin agriculture (farming) for pest control. Sodium azide is also used in detonators and other \\nexplosives. Breathing the gas that is formed from sodium azide causes the most harm. \\nHowever, ingesting (swallowing) sodium azide can be toxic (harmful) as well. The gas \\nformed from sodium azide is most dangerous in enclosed places where the gas will be \\ntrapped. The toxic gas quickly spreads in open spaces, making it less harmful outdoors. \\nThe gas formed from sodium azide is less dense (lighter) than air, so it will rise. Sodium \\nazide prevents the cells of the body from using oxygen. When this happens, the cells die. The \\nheart and the brain use a lot of oxygen. Therefore, sodium azide is more harmful to the \\nheart and the brain than to other organs. The level of sodium azide poisoning depends on \\nthe amount, route (how someone was exposed), and for how long. It also depends on the \\nperson's age and if they had any medical conditions when they were exposed. People can be \\nexposed to sodium azide by breathing it, absorbing it through their skin, or eating foods \\nwith it. Exposure to a small amount may have some or all of the following symptoms within \\nminutes: Exposure to a large amount of sodium azide by any route may cause these other \\nhealth effects as well: Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a \\nperson has been exposed to sodium azide. If sodium azide is in water, you could be exposed \\nto sodium azide by drinking the water. If sodium azide came into contact with food, you \\ncould be exposed to sodium azide by eating the food. If sodium azide is in the air, you could \\nbe exposed by breathing in the dust or the gas. Sodium azide can also enter the body and \\ncause symptoms through skin contact. An explosion with sodium azide can cause burn \\ninjury and expose people to the toxic gas, hydrozoic acid. Get fresh air by leaving the area \\nwhere the sodium azide was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to \\nreduce the chances of death from sodium azide. If the sodium azide was released outside, \\nmove away from the area where the sodium azide was released. Stay low to the ground, \\nbecause sodium azide gas rises. If sodium azide was released indoors, get out of the \\nbuilding.

If a person who has swallowed sodium azide is vomiting, stay away \\nfrom the person. Also stay away from the stomach contents (vomit) to avoid exposure to the \\ntoxic gas. \\n \\nSeek medical attention right away. If you are near a sodium azide release, emergency teams \\nmay tell you toevacuateor \"shelter in place\" inside. Remove the clothing as quickly as \\npossible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not \\ntouch unsafe areas. Wash any sodium azide from your skin with lots of soap and water. \\nWashing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body. If your \\neyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 \\nminutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put \\nthe contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear \\neyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you \\nwash them. After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not \\ntouch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can\\'t avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren\\'t \\nsure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, \\nsticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag. Anything that touches the dirty \\nclothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, \\ntoo. Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your \\nclothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your \\nclothes. When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them \\nwhat you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for \\nfurther disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself. No specific antidote (cure) exists \\nfor sodium azide poisoning.

It was originally developed as an insecticide (insect killer) in \\nGermany in 1944. Nerve agents are the most toxic (harmful) and fast acting of the known \\nchemical warfare agents. Nerve agents are similar to pesticides (insect killers) called \\norganophosphates. They are similar in terms of how they work and the kinds of harmful \\neffects they cause. However, nerve agents are much stronger than organophosphate \\npesticides. Soman is a clear, colorless, tasteless liquid with a slight smell similar to camphor \\ncontaining mothballs or rotten fruit. It can become a vapor (gas) if heated. Soman is not \\nfound naturally in the environment. It is possible that soman or other nerve agents were \\nused in chemical warfare during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. All the nerve agents cause \\ntheir toxic effects by preventing enzymes from working. Enzymes act as the body\\'s \"off \\nswitch\" for glands and muscles. Without an \"off switch,\" the glands and muscles are \\nconstantly being stimulated (worked). They may get tired and no longer be able to keep \\nworking on things such as breathing. Compared with other nerve agents, soman is more \\nvolatile thanVX(the strongest nerve agent) but less volatile than sarin. Higher volatility \\nmeans it is more likely to evaporate from a liquid into a gas and spread into the \\nenvironment. Because soman is more volatile than VX, it will stay on surfaces for a shorter \\nperiod of time compared with VX. People can be exposed to the gas even if they do not come \\nin contact with the liquid form. \\nBecause of its high volatility, soman is an immediate but short-lived threat. Soman does not \\nlast a long time in the environment. The level of soman poisoning depends on the amount of \\nsoman, how the person was exposed, and for how long. Symptoms will likely appear within \\na few seconds after exposure to the vapor (gas) form of soman. Symptoms will likely appear \\nwithin a few minutes to hours after exposure to the liquid form. People can be exposed to \\nsoman by breathing it in, swallowing, or through skin absorption. Exposure to a low or \\nmedium amount can cause some or all of the following symptoms within seconds to hours: \\nEven a tiny drop of nerve agent on the skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching where \\nthe agent touched. Exposure to a large amount of soman in any way can cause these '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 777, 'page_label': '860'}, page_content=\"additional negative health effects: Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily \\nmean that a person has been exposed to soman. Soman can have a camphor or fruity smell. \\nHowever, the smell may not be noticeable or strong enough to give people enough of a \\nwarning. If soman is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact or by \\nbreathing it in. Because soman vapor (gas) is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and \\nincrease chances of exposure there. Soman mixes easily with water, so it could be used to \\npoison water. If soman is in the water, people can be exposed by drinking the water or \\ngetting the water on their skin. If soman is in food, people can be exposed by eating the food. \\nA person's clothes can also release soman if it touched soman gas, which can expose other \\npeople. Recovery from soman exposure is possible with treatment, but the antidotes (cure) \\nmust be used quickly (within minutes) to be effective. Therefore, the best thing to do is \\navoid exposure Get fresh air by leaving the area where the soman was released. Moving to \\nan area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the chances of death from soman. If the \\nsoman was released outdoors, move away from the area where the soman was released. Go \\nto the highest ground possible, because soman is heavier than air and will sink to lower \\nareas. If soman was released indoors, get out of the building. If you swallowed soman, do \\nnot force vomiting or drink fluids. Get medical attention right away. If you think you were \\nexposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. \\nRemove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the \\nhead. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas. Put your clothing inside a \\nplastic bag. Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away \\nyour clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on \\nyour clothes. When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them \\nwhat you did with your clothes. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself. Wash any soman \\nfrom your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you \\nfrom any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse \\nyour eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. Treatment involves removing soman from \\nthe body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care in a hospital setting. \\nAntidotes (cures) are available for soman. They are most useful if given as soon as possible \\nafter exposure. Clinicians should treat suspected cases based on the situation and should \\nnot wait for laboratory confirmation. Mildly exposed people usually recover completely. \\nSeverely exposed people are not likely to survive.

An animal infected with orf virus typically has sores \\n(lesions) around its lips and muzzle and in its mouth. People infected with orf virus usually \\nget sores or nodules on their hands or forearms. This rash is infectious, meaning it can \\nspread to areas of a person's body if they scratch or touch the sores. The sores progress \\nthrough stages over six weeks. They may also have mild fever, tiredness or swelling of the \\nglands in their neck and underarms (lymph nodes). People with weakened immune systems \\ncan develop more serious symptoms if they get infected with orf virus. They may have \\nmultiple sores or large tumor-like sores. They may also develop a second type of rash that \\nisn't infectious (called erythema multiforme). People can get sore mouth disease if they \\nhave a cut or abrasion and touch an animal with orf virus. People can also get orf by \\nhandling equipment used with sick animals. Activities that may put people at more risk for \\ninfection include: Orf virus does not spread between people. People can get infected with \\norf virus multiple times. Infections after the first one are usually less severe and may heal \\nfaster. Wear rubber or latex gloves when handling sheep or goats. This is especially \\nimportant if you have cuts on your hands or are touching an animal's mouth or muzzle. \\nWash your hands often with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially if they \\nlook dirty. If there is no soap and your hands aren't visibly dirty, use alcohol-based hand \\nsanitizer. CDC offers a test that can determine if your sores are caused by orf virus. \\nHealthcare providers or health departments can send lesion specimens to CDC for testing. \\nMore information is available in theCDC test directory. CDC also has tools to help with \\ndiagnosis and can be reached at (404) 639-4129. Members of the public should contact \\ntheir healthcare provider or county/state health department for more information. There is \\nno specific treatment to cure orf virus infection. But it's important to protect the sores from \\ngetting infected with other germs. Keep the sores dry and covered with a bandage. Use a \\nbandage that keeps water out when working with animals or doing manual labor. If your \\nsores are dry at bedtime, keep them uncovered while you sleep. If they are wet, cover sores \\nloosely with a bandage. This will help them heal faster. See your doctor if you have pain, \\nfever or if your sores are getting bigger or spreading. If this occurs, it could mean your sores \\nare due to a different, more serious germ.

The rash \\nmay be accompanied by fatigue, fever, headache, muscle and joint pains. This condition has \\nbeen named southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI). The cause of STARI is not known, \\nbut studies have excludedBorrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, as its \\ncause. The rash of STARI is a red, expanding lesion that develops around the site of a lone \\nstar tick bite. The rash usually appears within 7 days of tick bite and expands to a diameter \\nof 3 inches (8 centimeters) or more, sometimes clearing as it enlarges to produce a target or \\n\"bull\\'s-eye\" appearance. The rash should not be confused with much smaller areas of \\nredness and discomfort that can occur commonly at the site of any tick bite. Patients may \\nalso experience fatigue, headache, fever, and muscle pains. The saliva from lone star ticks \\ncan be irritating; redness and discomfort at a bite site does not necessarily indicate an \\ninfection. STARI is specifically associated with bites ofAmblyomma americanum, known \\ncommonly as the lone star tick.

The bacteria that cause RBF is part of the natural germs in these \\nrodents' bodies. Rodents that are carrying the bacteria that cause RBF do not show signs of \\nillness, so it's not possible to tell if a rodent carries the bacteria just by looking at it. If you \\nknow you were bitten or scratched by a rodent, and you develop symptoms consistent with \\nRBF, you should seek medical care immediately. The infection is resistant to many \\ncommonly used antibiotics. Getting treatment with the right antibiotics is important to keep \\nthe disease from progressing. Thankfully, RBF is rare in the United States. But you should \\nknow many of these rodents that can carry it are popular pets, which can put people at risk. \\nPeople who work in pet stores or labs with rodents also could be at higher risk. The early \\nsymptoms of RBF can be like the flu. If you were infected by contact with rodents in North \\nAmerica, symptoms usually include fever, vomiting, headache, and muscle pain. About half \\nof people will also have joint pain or swelling, and 3 in 4 will develop a rash. Symptoms \\nusually begin 3 to 10 days after your contact with rodents. They can appear up to 21 days \\nafter the contact. By that time, the bite or scratch should be healed. This might make it hard \\nto remember you were bitten. Within 2 to 4 days after the fever begins, a rash may appear \\non the hands and feet. This rash looks like flat, reddened areas with small bumps. One or \\nmore joints may then become swollen, red, or painful. The bacteria that cause RBF in Asia \\ncan be different than the bacteria that causes RBF in North America. If you were infected by \\ncontact with rodents in Asia, your symptoms might be different. They can include fever, \\nswelling around the bite if you have one, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. As with the type of \\nRBF found in North America, getting early treatment is important to protecting your health. \\nComplications of RBF can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. \\nThe disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, \\nlungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. Early treatment with antibiotics is important to try \\nto prevent complications of RBF. These complications can include pockets of infected fluid \\nin the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, \\nincluding the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. These complications \\nare rare but can be very serious and even deadly. RBF can spread to people through \\nscratches, bites, or contact with a rodent's saliva or pee. It can also spread by having contact \\nwith contaminated materials (rat bedding, cages, etc.), kissing pet rats, or eating or drinking \\ncontaminated food or drinks. RBF transmission does not necessarily require contact with \\nrodents. If you have pet rodents or handle rodents as feed for snakes/reptiles, you can be at \\nincreased risk for RBF. Other at risk include people who work at pet stores or laboratories \\nwhere they may have contact with rodents. Although rare, some animals like dogs, cats, \\nferrets, and rabbits can be infected by contact with infected rodents and then pass the \\ninfection on to people. People usually start to show signs they are sick 3-10 days after \\nexposure. RBF cannot spread between people. You can lower your risk for RBF by avoiding \\ncontact with rodents, places with rodent infestations, or other areas where rodents may be \\npresent. Although RBF is rare, it is important to take precautions and practice good hygiene \\nwhen handling or coming into contact with rodents or potentially contaminated materials. If \\nyou have pet rodents, handle rodents as feed for reptiles, or work with rodents in a pet \\nstore or laboratory, protect yourself from RBF by followingCDC's small mammal guidance.

It affects both \\npeople and animals. People get infected whenSporothrixgets in cuts or scrapes. For \\nexample, infections can be caused by pricks from rose thorns or scratches from an infected \\ncat. Cat-associated sporotrichosis is a growing global public health concern. Usually, \\nsporotrichosis causes severe skin infections. Less commonly, it can cause eye or lung \\ninfections. Very rarely, the infection can spread to other parts of the body. Sporotrichosis is \\nlisted by theWorld Health Organizationas a neglected tropical disease. It is found \\nworldwide, but most cases are among impoverished communities and causes devastating \\nhealth, social, and economic consequences. Sporothrix schenckii(S. schenckii) is the most \\ncommon species ofSporothrixin the U.S.. Most infections withS. schenckiiare caused by \\ncontact with plants. Rarely, this strain can spread from animals to humans. In South \\nAmerica, the most common species isSporothrix brasiliensis(S. brasilliensis). Unlike most \\ncases ofS. schenckii,most people get infected withS. brasiliensisthrough contact with \\ninfected cats. Infections withS. brasiliensistend to be more severe than infections with \\notherSporothrixspecies. There have not been any reported spread ofS. brasiliensisin the U.S. \\nto date. The symptoms of sporotrichosis depend on how and where the fungus gets into the \\nbody. Most infections are through the skin. Symptoms start anytime from 1 to 12 weeks \\nafter exposure. Cutaneous (skin)- Starts as a small painless red, purple, or pink bump on the \\nskin. Over time, more bumps may start to appear and grow larger. Eventually they may start \\nto pus, become open sores, and spread up the arm or from the infection site. Ocular (eye)- \\nRedness of the eye, redness or swelling of the eyelid, eye pain, and possible vision changes. \\nPulmonary (lung)- Cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever.

The CDC \\nSteven M. Teutsch Prevention Effectiveness (PE) Fellowship is a two-year, post-doctoral, \\napplied training fellowship. It addresses public health demand for quantitative policy \\nanalysis, health economics-based inquiry, integrative health services research, and rigorous \\ndecision modeling. The Traditional Track is offered for economists and health services \\nresearchers. The Analytics and Modeling Track is intended for disease modelers, ecologists, \\noperations researchers, industrial engineers, and applied mathematicians. Since 1995, CDC \\nhas recruited and trained effective decision scientists through the fellowship. With each \\nnew class, the PE Fellowship builds a cadre of scientists whose research provides vital \\ninformation to decision makers. CDC, congress, and nongovernmental agencies use \\ninformation on resource allocation to maximize the impact of public health programs. \\nPrevention effectiveness uses econometrics, decision science, simulation, operations \\nanalysis and modeling. The purpose is to understand determinants of health; morbidity and \\nmortality; health inequalities and disparities; the cost of public health services and \\npreventive interventions; the burden of illnesses; impact of regulations on population \\nhealth; and ways to optimize resources for public health. In 2021, the PE Fellowship began \\noffering the Analytics and Modeling Track to engage scientists with backgrounds in applied \\nmathematics, operations research, applied epidemiology, evolutionary biology, and other \\ndisciplines. Fellows in this track develop knowledge of modeling and related subjects such \\nas mathematical modeling, analytical epidemiology, microsimulation, dynamic \\ncompartmental models, and network models. Learn more about the Analytics and Modeling \\nTrack atWhat Fellows Do. The PE Fellowship is the largest two-year post-doctoral training \\nprogram of its kind in the U.S. It recruits the vast majority of economists and disease \\nmodelers at CDC. Along with many other contributions to public health, PE fellows and \\nalumni have published an estimated 5,000 papers in peer-reviewed journals in 30 years. \\nThe CDC Steven M.

Arsine is formed when arsenic comes in contact with an acid. Arsine is similar to \\na gas called stibine, which is formed when the metal antimony comes in contact with an \\nacid. Stibine has health effects similar to those of arsine, but it is not as widely available. \\nStibine also has a noticeable \"rotten egg\" smell. Arsine is most commonly used in the \\nsemiconductor and metals refining industries. Arsine was studied as a warfare agent during \\nWorld War II, but it was never used on the battlefield. After arsine enters the bloodstream, \\nit damages the red blood cells. This can lead to symptoms of hemolytic anemia, when red \\nblood cells die faster than the body can replace them. The effects of arsine poisoning depend \\non how much arsine a person was exposed to and how long the exposure was. Depending \\non the level of exposure to arsine, symptoms are likely to occur within the first 24 hours \\nafter exposure. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person \\nhas been exposed to arsine. Breathing in the gas is the most likely way of exposure after \\narsine is released into the air. Arsine is not absorbed into the body through the eyes and the \\nskin. At lower amounts, people may not know they have been exposed to arsine, because it \\nhas no smell. At higher amounts, a mild garlic smell (however, do not rely on this as a \\nwarning). On the other hand, stibine has a strong smell, so people may notice that they may \\nhave been exposed. Most reports of exposure are when arsine is accidentally made in the \\nworkplace. Arsine gas is heavier than air, so it would be more likely to settle in lower areas. \\nBecause there is no cure for arsine exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it. First,get fresh \\nairby leaving the area where the arsine is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to \\nreduce the possibility of death from arsine. If arsine was released outside, move away from \\nthe area. \\nIf arsine was released indoors, get out of the building. If you are near an arsine release, \\nemergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or \"shelter in place\" inside. For more \\ninformation on evacuation during a chemical emergency, visit \"Responding to Evacuation.\" \\nFor more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, visit \\n\"Responding to Sheltering in Place.\" Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. \\nCut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. \\nIf you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.

If you \\nknow you were bitten or scratched by a rodent, and you develop symptoms consistent with \\nRBF, you should seek medical care immediately. The infection is resistant to many \\ncommonly used antibiotics. Getting treatment with the right antibiotics is important to keep \\nthe disease from progressing. Thankfully, RBF is rare in the United States. But you should \\nknow many of these rodents that can carry it are popular pets, which can put people at risk. \\nPeople who work in pet stores or labs with rodents also could be at higher risk. The early \\nsymptoms of RBF can be like the flu. If you were infected by contact with rodents in North \\nAmerica, symptoms usually include fever, vomiting, headache, and muscle pain. About half \\nof people will also have joint pain or swelling, and 3 in 4 will develop a rash. Symptoms \\nusually begin 3 to 10 days after your contact with rodents. They can appear up to 21 days \\nafter the contact. By that time, the bite or scratch should be healed. This might make it hard \\nto remember you were bitten. Within 2 to 4 days after the fever begins, a rash may appear \\non the hands and feet. This rash looks like flat, reddened areas with small bumps. One or \\nmore joints may then become swollen, red, or painful. The bacteria that cause RBF in Asia \\ncan be different than the bacteria that causes RBF in North America. If you were infected by \\ncontact with rodents in Asia, your symptoms might be different. They can include fever, \\nswelling around the bite if you have one, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. As with the type of \\nRBF found in North America, getting early treatment is important to protecting your health. \\nComplications of RBF can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. \\nThe disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, \\nlungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. Early treatment with antibiotics is important to try \\nto prevent complications of RBF. These complications can include pockets of infected fluid \\nin the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, \\nincluding the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. These complications \\nare rare but can be very serious and even deadly. RBF can spread to people through \\nscratches, bites, or contact with a rodent's saliva or pee. It can also spread by having contact \\nwith contaminated materials (rat bedding, cages, etc.), kissing pet rats, or eating or drinking \\ncontaminated food or drinks. RBF transmission does not necessarily require contact with \\nrodents. If you have pet rodents or handle rodents as feed for snakes/reptiles, you can be at \\nincreased risk for RBF. Other at risk include people who work at pet stores or laboratories \\nwhere they may have contact with rodents. Although rare, some animals like dogs, cats, \\nferrets, and rabbits can be infected by contact with infected rodents and then pass the \\ninfection on to people.

Only a small amount is needed to cause \\nserious effects in people. Strychnine poisoning can cause extremely serious negative health \\neffects, including death. Strychnine is a white, odorless, bitter crystalline powder. It can be \\ntaken by mouth, breathed in, or mixed in a solution and given intravenously (injected \\ndirectly into a vein). The main natural source of strychnine is the plantStrychnos nux-\\nvomica. This plant is found in southern Asia (India, Sri Lanka, and East Indies) and \\nAustralia. In the past, strychnine was available in a pill form and was used to treat many \\nhuman illnesses. \\nToday, strychnine is used mainly as a pesticide, particularly to kill rats. Uncommonly, \\nstrychnine is found mixed with \"street\" drugs such as LSD, heroin, and cocaine. Strychnine \\nstops the chemical that controls nerve signals to the muscles from working. The chemical \\ncontrolling nerve signals works like the body\\'s \"off switch\" for muscles. When this \"off \\nswitch\" does not work correctly, muscles throughout the body have severe, painful spasms. \\nThe person\\'s consciousness or thinking are not affected at first, except that the person is \\nvery excitable and in pain. However, eventually the muscles tire and the person can\\'t \\nbreathe. The level of strychnine poisoning depends on the amount and how someone was \\nexposed. It also depends on the person\\'s health at the time of the exposure. After \\nswallowing strychnine, symptoms of poisoning usually appear within 15 to 60 minutes. \\nPeople exposed to a low or medium amount by any route of exposure will have the \\nfollowing signs or symptoms: People exposed to high amounts may have the following signs \\nand symptoms within the first 15 to 30 minutes of exposure: Showing these signs and \\nsymptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to strychnine. It is \\nalso possible to absorb strychnine through the nose, eyes, or mouth. For example, a person \\ncould be poisoned by breathing in strychnine powder that has been released in the air. \\nStrychnine could be smoked or snorted as a part of street drugs. \\nPoisoning has been reported from strychnine given intravenously (in the vein) and through \\nthe nose. If strychnine is in water, you could be exposed by drinking the water. If strychnine \\nis in food, you could be exposed by eating the food. Recovery from strychnine exposure is \\npossible with early hospital treatment. Therefore, the best thing to do is get medical care as \\nquickly as possible. If you think strychnine may have been released into the air, the best \\nthing to do is get away from it. If the strychnine release was indoors, get out of the building. '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 802, 'page_label': '885'}, page_content='If the release was outdoors, move away from the area of the release. Stay upwind if possible \\nand go to higher ground. Quickly moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to lower the \\nchance of death from strychnine.

Digestive signs and symptoms include: Eye signs and symptoms \\ninclude: Respiratory (breathing) signs and symptoms include: Skin signs and symptoms \\ninclude: Other signs and symptoms include: Sulfur mustard can last 1 to 2 days in the \\nenvironment in average weather conditions. Sulfur mustard can last weeks to months in \\nvery cold conditions. Follow any directions by local authorities. If sulfur mustard is in the \\nair, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing it in. Because \\nsulfur mustard gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase chances of \\nexposure there. Do not stay in lower areas. If clothing touched sulfur mustard, people can be \\nexposed by touching or breathing in sulfur mustard gas from the clothing. Eating, drinking, \\nor touching food or drink with sulfur mustard can expose people to sulfur mustard. Do not \\nuse or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have touched \\nsulfur mustard if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken \\nand sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected. Wash the outside of the \\ncontainer before using. If sulfur mustard is in water, people can be exposed by touching or \\ndrinking the water.  \\nPeople can also be exposed by swallowing liquid sulfur mustard, getting it on their skin, or \\ngetting it in their eyes. Get away from the area where the sulfur mustard was released and \\nbreathe fresh air. If the sulfur mustard release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in \\nplace. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure \\nthe sulfur mustard does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the \\nsulfur mustard was released. If the sulfur mustard release was indoors, get out of the \\nbuilding and go to higher ground. If you cannot get away, go to the highest ground possible. \\nSulfur mustard is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas. Get clean by taking off all \\nclothes, jewelry, and accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. Ideally, undress, blot, \\nand shower immediately or as soon as you can, as described below. If you cannot take off all \\nlayers, take off as many clothes as you can. Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must \\npull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will \\nstop the sulfur mustard from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic \\nbag. If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put \\ncontact lenses back in. Follow these steps to blot your body: Repeat the process several \\ntimes if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your \\nbody. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process. Wash your hair, \\nface, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with \\na lot of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for 90 seconds. Use soapy water for a \\nminute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your \\neyes, nose, or mouth.Do not scrub! If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash \\nyour eyes for 10 to 15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops. Dry your face, \\nthen tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that \\nwill soak up water. Drop used things to the floor.

NCHS currently conducts four \\npopulation surveys. Population surveys collect data from a group of participants who \\nbelong to and represent a larger group of people. The larger group of people is the \\npopulation being studied. NCHS population surveys collect data from individual people and \\nhouseholds in the United States. NCHS collects data from healthcare professionals and \\nadministrators working in a range of healthcare settings through the National Health Care \\nSurveys. These surveys provide information about the organizations and providers that \\ndeliver health care, the services they provide, and the patients they serve across diverse \\nsettings. Surveys are not NCHS's only method of gathering health information. NCHS also \\nuses data shared from existing health information sources. The National Vital Statistics \\nSystem draws data from information reported on birth and death certificates. States and \\nterritories collect, complete, and maintain these records, which they share with NCHS to \\ncreate the nation's vital statistics. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey \\n(NHANES) monitors the health and nutritional status of adults and children across the \\nUnited States. NHANES is unique among population surveys because it combines \\ninterviews, health exams, lab tests, and dietary interviews. Each year, NHANES examines \\nabout 5,000 people across the country in Mobile Exam Centers. NHANES provides \\nimportant health and nutrition statistics on adults and children living in the United States. \\nIn health exams, NHANES experts can directly measure height, weight, vision, dental health, \\nand other health characteristics. Lab tests can detect undiagnosed health conditions, like \\ndiabetes, and past contact with substances in air, water, food, or soil that may harm health, \\ncalled environmental exposures. Findings from NHANES have driven national and state \\npolicies to protect and improve the health of children and adults. The National Health \\nInterview Survey (NHIS) monitors the health of the U.S. population by collecting and \\nanalyzing data on a broad range of health topics. NHIS focuses on the health of U.S. children \\nand adults. Each year, NHIS collects data from about 28,000 adults through personal \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 811, 'page_label': '894'}, page_content=\"interviews. Parents also provide health information about children in their households. \\nCollecting data from this many people (the survey's sample) allows NHIS to produce official \\nnational estimates. The robust data NHIS collects can be analyzed by many characteristics \\nto help us better understand how health differs among groups within the U.S. population. \\nNHIS results have provided important data to track health status, health insurance \\ncoverage, unmet healthcare needs, and progress toward achieving national health goals. \\nThe National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) is a survey of people ages 15?49. NSFG \\ngathers information on pregnancy and births, marriage, living arrangements, infertility, use \\nof birth control, family life, and general and reproductive health. NSFG uses online surveys \\nand personal interviews to collect data on these topics. Participants answer more sensitive \\nquestions on their own. NSFG methods produce national statistics. The U.S. Department of \\nHealth and Human Services and other government agencies use NSFG data to plan health \\nand social services and health education programs. Researchers use these data to conduct \\nstatistical studies of families, fertility, and health. NCHS Rapid Surveys provide data for \\nevidence-based decision-making and faster public health response. NCHS fields Rapid \\nSurveys several times each year using commercial online survey panels. Each survey \\nincludes a broad range of questions based on CDC?s needs at that time, so no two Rapid \\nSurveys are alike. Rapid Surveys can be used to? The National Ambulatory Medical Care \\nSurvey (NAMCS) collects data about medical services provided in offices for patients who \\naren't admitted to a hospital or other facility. NAMCS collects and releases high quality, \\nobjective, reliable information about how these ambulatory medical care services are \\nprovided and used in the United States.  NAMCS collects data from both office-based \\nphysicians and health centers. In addition to data about provider, practice, and health \\ncenter characteristics, NAMCS collects information about telemedicine use, electronic health \\nrecords use, and healthcare delivery. NAMCS data support? The National Electronic Health \\nRecords Survey (NEHRS) measures the progress U.S. physicians and their offices have made \\nin adopting electronic health records (EHRs). The survey also monitors progress toward \\nelectronic sharing of health data (health information exchange) and the burden associated \\nwith EHRs. NEHRS collects data about EHR use from office-based physicians practicing in \\nthe United States. NEHRS data tracks participation in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \\nServices' Promoting Interoperability Programs. In addition, researchers can use NEHRS \\ndata to produce state and national estimates of EHR adoption, capabilities, and burden. The \\nNational Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) collected data about medical \\nservices for patients who were treated in hospital emergency and outpatient departments \\nwithout being admitted to the hospital. NCHS conducted NHAMCS annually through 2022. \\nThe survey collected and released high quality, objective, reliable information about how \\nhospital-based ambulatory medical care services were provided and used in the United \\nStates. To collect NHAMCS data, information was manually taken from medical records. \\nNow, the widespread use of electronic health records allows this information to be shared \\nelectronically, including with public health authorities like NCHS, more easily. The National \\nHospital Care Survey (NHCS) collects data on patient care in hospital emergency \\ndepartments and inpatient discharges. NHCS data describe patterns of health care delivery \\nand use in the United States. NHCS answers questions about use of healthcare and \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 812, 'page_label': '895'}, page_content=\"healthcare resources, and the differences in healthcare services that some people and \\ngroups experience. NHCS collects data on patient care and resource use in hospital-based \\nsettings. Participating hospitals electronically submit inpatient discharge and emergency \\ndepartment visit data. Hospitals also provide summary information about patient visits for \\nthe calendar year through an additional, supplemental interview. Healthcare and public \\nhealth professionals, researchers, and policymakers use NHCS data to track trends affecting \\nhospital and healthcare organizations, and the patients they serve. The National Post-acute \\nand Long-term Care Study (NPALS) collects and analyzes data from U.S. providers serving \\npeople who need continuing care after urgent medical treatment (post-acute care) or who \\ncannot care for themselves for a long period (long-term care). NPALS provides information \\non seven major sectors of paid, regulated, post-acute and long-term care services, providers, \\nand services users. NPALS uses existing Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data for \\nfive sectors, and collects data directly from adult day services centers and residential care \\ncommunities. NPALS data are used to describe and understand how long-term care services \\nare delivered and the changes that occur in the delivery of those services over time. \\nPolicymakers use these data to make evidence-based policy decisions. Directors of post-\\nacute and long-term care facilities use this information for comparison with their peers. \\nResearchers use NPALS statistics to examine the effectiveness of various care models. The \\nNational Vital Statistics System (NVSS) provides the nation's official vital statistics. NVSS \\ndraws these statistics from information reported on birth and death certificates. NVSS is the \\noldest, most successful example of intergovernmental data sharing in public health. \\nThrough NVSS, 50 states, New York City, District of Columbia, and 5 U.S. territories send \\nNCHS information on the nearly 7 million vital events?births, deaths, and fetal deaths?that \\nhappen each year. NCHS collects, analyzes, and shares these data to create the nation's \\nofficial vital statistics. NVSS provides the most complete and continuous data available to \\npublic health officials at the national, state, and local levels, and in the private sector. NVSS \\nvital statistics are a critical part of the national health information system, providing data to \\nmonitor progress toward achieving important health goals.

These parasites are released from infected snails into fresh and salt water (such \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 813, 'page_label': '896'}, page_content=\"as lakes, ponds, and oceans). While the parasite?s preferred host is the specific bird or \\nmammal, if the parasite comes into contact with a swimmer, it burrows into the skin \\ncausing an allergic reaction and rash. Swimmer?s itch is found throughout the world and is \\nmore frequent during summer months. Symptoms can include Within minutes to days after \\nswimming in contaminated water, you may experience tingling, burning, or itching of the \\nskin. Small reddish pimples appear within twelve hours. Pimples may develop into small \\nblisters. Scratching the areas may result in secondary bacterial infections. Itching may last \\nup to a week or more but will gradually go away. Because swimmer?s itch is caused by an \\nallergic reaction to infection, the more often you swim or wade in contaminated water, the \\nmore likely you are to develop more serious symptoms. The greater the number of \\nexposures to contaminated water, the more intense and immediate symptoms of \\nswimmer?s itch will be. Be aware that swimmer's itch is not the only rash that may occur \\nafter swimming in fresh or salt water. Anyone who swims or wades in infested water may \\nbe at risk. Larvae are more likely to be present in shallow water by the shoreline. Children \\nare most often affected because they tend to swim, wade, and play in the shallow water \\nmore than adults. Also, they are less likely to towel dry themselves when leaving the water. \\nMany factors must be present for swimmer?s itch to become a problem in water. Since these \\nfactors change (sometimes within a swim season), swimmer?s itch will not always be a \\nproblem. However, there is no way to know how long water may be unsafe. Larvae \\ngenerally survive for 24 hours once they are released from the snail. However, an infected \\nsnail will continue to produce cercariae throughout the remainder of its life. For future \\nsnails to become infected, migratory birds or mammals in the area must also be infected so \\nthe lifecycle can continue. As long as your swimming pool is well maintained and \\nchlorinated, there is no risk of swimmer?s itch. The appropriate snails must be present in \\norder for swimmer?s itch to occur. The adult parasite lives in the blood of infected animals \\nsuch as ducks, geese, gulls, swans, and certain mammals such as muskrats and raccoons. \\nThe parasites produce eggs that are passed in the feces of infected birds or mammals. If the \\neggs land in or are washed into the water, the eggs hatch, releasing small, free-swimming \\nmicroscopic larvae. These larvae swim in the water in search of a certain species of aquatic \\nsnail. If the larvae find one of these snails, they infect the snail, multiply and undergo further \\ndevelopment. Infected snails release a different type of microscopic larvae (or cercariae, \\nhence the name cercarial dermatitis) into the water. This larval form then swims about \\nsearching for a suitable host (bird, muskrat) to continue the lifecycle. Although humans are \\nnot suitable hosts, the microscopic larvae burrow into the swimmer?s skin, and may cause \\nan allergic reaction and rash. Because these larvae cannot develop inside a human, they \\nsoon die. To reduce the likelihood of developing swimmer?s itch Most cases of swimmer?s \\nitch do not require medical attention. If you have a rash, you may try the following for relief: \\nThough difficult, try not to scratch. Scratching may cause the rash to become infected. If \\nitching is severe, your health care provider may suggest prescription-strength lotions or \\ncreams to lessen your symptoms. Swimmer?s itch, or cercarial dermatitis, appears as a skin \\nrash caused by an allergic reaction to certain microscopic parasites found in fresh and salt \\nwater.

Nerve agents are the most toxic (harmful) and fast acting \\nof the known chemical warfare agents. Nerve agents are similar to a type of pesticide called \\norganophosphates. They are similar in terms of how they work and the kinds of harmful \\neffects they cause. However, nerve agents are much stronger than organophosphate \\npesticides. It can be described as: Tabun is not found naturally in the environment. It is \\npossible that tabun and/or other nerve agents were used in chemical warfare during the \\nIran-Iraq War in the 1980s. All the nerve agents cause their toxic effects by preventing \\nenzymes from working. Enzymes act as the body\\'s \"off switch\" for glands and muscles. \\nWithout an \"off switch,\" the glands and muscles are constantly working. They may get tired \\nand no longer be able to keep working on things such as breathing. Compared with other \\nnerve agents, tabun is more volatile thanVX(another nerve agent) but less volatile \\nthansarin. Because of its high volatility, tabun is an immediate health threat. A higher \\nvolatility means it is more likely to: People can be exposed to the gas even if they do not \\ncome in contact with the liquid form. Because of its high volatility, tabun is an immediate \\nhealth threat. The level of tabun poisoning depends on the amount and form (gas or liquid) \\nof tabun a person was exposed to. It also depends on how the person was exposed (e.g., skin \\ncontact, breathing in gas, etc.) and for how long. Symptoms likely will appear within a few \\nseconds after exposure to the gas form of tabun. Symptoms will likely appear and within a \\nfew minutes to hours after exposure to the liquid form. People can be exposed to a low or \\nmedium amount of tabun by breathing it in, swallowing it, or skin absorption. Exposure to \\nlow to medium amounts may lead to some or all of the following symptoms within seconds \\nto hours: Even a small drop of a nerve agent on the skin can cause sweating and muscle '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 818, 'page_label': '901'}, page_content='twitching where the agent touched. Exposure to a large amount of tabun in any way can \\ncause these additional health effects: Showing these signs and symptoms does not \\nnecessarily mean that a person has been exposed to tabun. If tabun is in the air, people can \\nbe exposed through skin or eye contact or by breathing it in. Because tabun vapor (gas) is \\nheavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase chances of exposure there. Tabun \\nmixes easily with water, so it could be used to poison water. If tabun is in the water, people \\ncan be exposed by drinking the water or getting the water on their skin. If tabun is in food, \\npeople can be exposed by eating the food. A person\\'s clothes can also release tabun if it \\ntouched tabun gas, which can expose other people. Tabun has a faint fruity smell. However, \\nthe smell may not be noticeable or strong enough to give people enough warning that it is \\nnear. Recovery from tabun exposure is possible with treatment, but the antidotes (cure) \\nmust be used quickly to be effective. Therefore, the best thing to do is avoid exposure. Get \\nfresh air by leaving the area where the tabun was released. Moving to an area with fresh air \\nis a good way to reduce the chances of death from tabun gas. If the tabun was released \\noutdoors, move away from the area where the tabun was released. Go to the highest ground \\npossible, because tabun is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas. If tabun was \\nreleased indoors, get out of the building. Remove the clothing with tabun on it as quickly as \\npossible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid \\ntouching unsafe areas. Put your clothing inside a plastic bag. Tie the bag, and then put that \\nbag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and \\nothers from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When the local or state health \\ndepartment or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. Do not \\nhandle the plastic bags yourself. For more information about cleaning your body and \\nthrowing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, visit \"About Getting Clean.\" Wash \\nany liquid tabun from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water \\nwill protect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is \\nblurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. Treatment involves \\nremoving tabun from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care in \\na hospital. Antidotes (cures) are available for tabun. They are most useful if given as soon as \\npossible after exposure. Mildly exposed people usually recover completely. Severely \\nexposed people are less likely to survive.

Talaromyces marneffeican change from its native mold \\nform in the environment to a parasitic yeast once in a warm-blooded host.In the \\nenvironment (at 25°C), the mold form produces yellow green colonies and a characteristic \\nsoluble red pigment (1). The mold produces spores that are easily aerosolized (2). The \\nspores are inhaled by the host and are settled into the lungs (3), where they are \\nphagocytosed by the host's alveolar macrophages (4).

Humans can become infected with these tapeworms by eating \\nraw or undercooked beef (T. saginata) or pork (T. soliumandT. asiatica). People with \\ntaeniasis may not know they have a tapeworm infection because symptoms are usually mild \\nor nonexistent. T.soliumtapeworm infections can lead tocysticercosis, which is a disease \\nthat can cause seizures, so it is important seek treatment. Taeniasis in humans is a parasitic \\ninfection caused by these tapeworm species Taenia saginataandT. soliumare found \\nworldwide. Infections withT. saginataoccur wherever contaminated raw beef is eaten, \\nparticularly in Eastern Europe, Russia, eastern Africa and Latin America. Taeniasis due toT. \\nsaginatais rare in the United States, except in places where cattle and people are \\nconcentrated and sanitation is poor, such as around feed lots where cattle can be exposed to \\nhuman feces. Tapeworm infections due toT. soliumare more prevalent in under-developed \\ncommunities with poor sanitation and where people eat raw or undercooked pork. Higher \\nrates of illness have been seen in people in Latin America, Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan \\nAfrica, India, and Asia.Taenia soliumtaeniasis is seen in the United States, typically among \\nLatin American immigrants.Taenia asiaticais limited to Asia and is seen mostly in the \\nRepublic of Korea, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand. Most people with tapeworm \\ninfections have no symptoms or mild symptoms. Patients withT. saginatataeniasis often \\nexperience more symptoms that those withT. solium or T. asiaticainfections because theT. \\nsaginatatapeworm is larger in size (up to 10 meters (m)) than the other two tapeworms \\n(usually 3 m). Tapeworms can cause digestive problems including abdominal pain, loss of \\nappetite, weight loss, and upset stomach. The most visible sign of taeniasis is the active \\npassing of proglottids (tapeworm segments) through the anus and in the feces. In rare \\ncases, tapeworm segments become lodged in the appendix, or the bile and pancreatic ducts. \\nTaenia saginatadoes not cause cysticercosis in humans. It is not clear ifT. asiaticacauses \\ncysticercosis in humans or not. Eating raw or undercooked contaminated beef or pork is the \\nprimary risk factor for acquiring taeniasis. Because of this, certain groups with dietary \\nrestrictions for these meats may have a lower risk of taeniasis. A disease \\ncalledcysticercosiscan occur whenT. soliumtapeworm eggs are ingested. For example, \\npeople with poor hygiene who have taeniasis?with or without symptoms?will shed \\ntapeworm eggs in their feces and might accidentally contaminate their environment. This '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 825, 'page_label': '908'}, page_content='can lead to transmission of cysticercosis to themselves or others unknowingly. One way to \\nprevent taeniasis is to cook meat to safe temperatures. A food thermometer should be used \\nto measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. Do not sample meat until it is cooked. \\nUSDA recommends the following for meat preparation. Cook to at least 145° F (63° C) as \\nmeasured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the \\nmeat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming. Cook to at least 160° F (71° C); \\nground meats do not require a rest* time. *According to USDA, \"A \\'rest time\\' is the amount \\nof time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, \\noven, or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed from the heat \\nsource, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys pathogens.\" \\nDiagnosis ofTaeniatapeworm infections is made by examination of stool samples; \\nindividuals should also be asked if they have passed tapeworm segments. Stool specimens \\nshould be collected on three different days and examined in the lab forTaeniaeggs using a \\nmicroscope. Tapeworm eggs can be detected in the stool 2 ? 3 months after the tapeworm \\ninfection is established. Tapeworm eggs ofT. soliumcan also infect humans, \\ncausingcysticercosis.

Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for \\nexample, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure. The effects usually only last 15 to 30 \\nminutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off. The level of poisoning \\ndepends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how \\nlong. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors). People exposed \\nto riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately \\nafter exposure: Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects \\nsuch as: Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has \\nbeen exposed to riot control agents.

Two types of mercury to which people may be exposed ? \\nmethylmercury and ethylmercury ? are very different. Methylmercury is the type of \\nmercury found in certain kinds of fish. At high exposure levels methylmercury can be toxic \\nto people. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible \\nout of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some \\nmethylmercury. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body \\nmore quickly than methylmercury, and is therefore less likely to cause any harm. \\nThimerosal is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose (multi-dose vials) \\nto prevent growth of germs, like bacteria and fungi. Introduction of bacteria and fungi has \\nthe potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for \\nadministration. Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, \\nserious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added \\nduring the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth. Thimerosal was taken out of \\nchildhood vaccines in the United States in 2001. For a complete list of vaccines and their \\nthimerosal content level, see the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Thimerosal in \\nVaccinespage. Thimerosal use in medical products has a record of being very safe. Data from \\nmany studies show no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in \\nvaccines.123456 The most common side-effects of thimerosal in vaccines are minor \\nreactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. Although rare, some people may be \\nallergic to thimerosal. Research does not show any link between thimerosal in vaccines \\nandautism, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Many well conducted studies have concluded \\nthat thimerosal in vaccines does not contribute to the development of autism.135Even after \\nthimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to \\nincrease, which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism. A \\n2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown that \\nprenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal does \\nnot increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).1 Studies have assessed the possible \\nassociation between ethyl mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing vaccines and \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 838, 'page_label': '921'}, page_content='neuropsychological functioning including an objective measurement of neuropsychological \\nfunctioning.

Some \\ntypes of mercury, like mercury in some kinds of fish, stay in the human body and can make \\npeople sick. Thimerosal is a different kind of mercury. It doesn?t stay in the body, and is \\nunlikely to make us sick. Yes. Thimerosal has been used safely in vaccines for a long time \\n(since the 1930s). Scientists have been studying the use of thimerosal in vaccines for many \\nyears. They haven?t found any evidence that thimerosal causes harm. No. Thimerosal hasn't \\nbeen used in vaccines for children since 2001. However, thimerosal is still used insome flu \\nvaccines. Yearly flu vaccines are recommended for all children. If you are worried about \\nthimerosal, you can ask for a flu vaccine without it. No. Research does not show any link \\nbetween thimerosal and autism. Most people don't have any side effects from thimerosal, \\nbut some people will have mild side effects like redness and swelling at the place where the \\nshot was given, which will only last 1 to 2 days. It's very unlikely you will have an allergic \\nreaction to thimerosal. Ask your doctor or pharmacist. Ask to see the vaccine's list of \\ningredients.

Tick-\\nborne encephalitis virus can be found in parts of the region stretching from western and \\nnorthern Europe to northern and eastern Asia. People who travel to these areas might be at \\nrisk for infection. Tick-borne encephalitis virus is not found in the United States. The ticks \\nthat spread tick-borne encephalitis virus are most active in warmer months (April through \\nNovember). People who spend time outdoors in or near forests are at highest risk of being \\nbitten by a tick infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus. Many people infected with tick-\\nborne encephalitis virus do not havesymptoms. Initial symptoms can include fever, \\nheadache, vomiting, and weakness. Severe disease often occurs including inflammation of \\nthe brain (encephalitis) or the membranes around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). \\nThere are no medications to treat tick-borne encephalitis.

If you have a rash, nail \\ninfection, or symptoms of ringworm, go to a healthcare provider for testing. You may go to \\nyour primary care provider, dermatologist, or podiatrist. Symptoms of ringworm are similar \\nto symptoms for other skin or nail conditions. Testing can help make sure you get the right \\ntreatment. Healthcare providers may take a small skin scraping or nail sample for testing. \\nThe treatment for ringworm depends on its location on the body and how serious the \\ninfection is. Some forms of ringworm can be treated with non-prescription (over-the-\\ncounter) antifungal medications. However, other forms of ringworm need treatment with \\nprescription antifungal medication.

Smoke from cigarettes, \\ncigars, and pipes has at least 70 chemicals that can cause cancer. Every time you breathe in \\nthat smoke, those chemicals get into your bloodstream, which carries the chemicals to all \\nparts of your body. Many of these chemicals can damage your DNA, which controls how \\nyour body makes new cells and directs each kind of cell to do what it is made for. Damaged \\nDNA can make cells grow differently from how they are supposed to. These unusual cells \\ncan turn into cancer. People who smoke are not the only people who can get cancer from \\ntobacco smoke. People around them?their kids, partners, friends, coworkers, and \\nothers?breathe in that smoke, too, calledsecondhand smoke. Smokeless tobacco products, \\nsuch as dipping and chewing tobacco, can cause cancer, too, including cancers of the \\nesophagus, mouth and throat, and pancreas. Electronic cigarettesmake a mist (often called a \\ncloud) by heating a liquid that contains flavorings and chemicals, many of which are \\nharmful. The liquid usually contains nicotine, the addictive drug in cigarettes and other \\ntobacco products. Users inhale the mist into their lungs. People nearby can also breathe in \\nthis mist.

The misfolding leads to brain damage and other symptoms. Symptoms may \\ntake years to develop. But once they do, the disease rapidly progresses and leads to death. \\nSome of the reasons people may get sick with prion diseases is eating or handling meat \\ncontaminated with prions. People may also become infected if they get prions in their \\nbodies. This may occur through organ transplant or being exposed to contaminated \\nequipment during surgery. Many different prion diseases affect people, but some are more \\ncommon than others. The most common prion disease in people is Creutzfeldt-Jakob \\ndisease (CJD). Another prion disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), has a similar \\nname but is a different, much rarer, disease. Other prion diseases include kuru, variably \\nprotease-sensitive prionopathy, sporadic fatal insomnia, and inherited forms caused by \\ngenetic mutations. CJD is a prion disease that causes a person\\'s brain to break down or stop \\nworking normally. Once symptoms start, the disease progresses quickly. It is always fatal, \\nusually within a year. CJD is sometimes called \"classic CJD\" to avoid confusion with variant \\nCJD. Most cases of classic CJD are in older people. They appear sporadically. This means \\nthere is no known reason that the cases begin. A smaller number of cases occur in people \\nwho inherited genetic changes that make them prone to CJD. Occasionally, there have also \\nbeen illnesses in people who were exposed to surgical equipment or other products \\ncontaminated with prions. vCJD is tied to eating beef from a cow that had a prion disease \\ncalled Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). It was discovered in 1996 in the United \\nKingdom. The disease affected much younger people than CJD. vCJD often infected people \\ntheir 20s or younger. It caused mental symptoms and behaviors, as well as pain when \\ntouching things (dyesthesiasis), that CJD does not. There have only been four vCJD cases \\nreported in the United States. All occurred in people who were likely exposed to BSE \\noutside the U.S. Though they have very similar names, CJD and vCJD are very different. They \\naffect different groups of people and have different causes. They have different symptoms \\nand affect the body differently. [Table goes here] There are a number of known prion \\ndiseases in animals. The two most important in the United States are bovine spongiform \\nencephalopathy (BSE) and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). BSE is a type of prion disease \\nthat affects cows. The first cases were identified in the mid-1980s, but BSE didn\\'t gain \\nwidespread attention until a major outbreak in the United Kingdom later that decade into '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 852, 'page_label': '935'}, page_content=\"the 1990s. Millions of cows were infected. By 2005, 24 countries had reported BSE among \\nnative cattle. (20 of the 24 were in Europe). The first BSE case in North America was \\nreported in 1993 in a cow imported into Canada from the United Kingdom. Additional BSE \\ncases were identified in Canada beginning in 2003. Later that year, a cow in Washington \\nState also tested positive. The cow had come from a Canadian farm prior to being imported \\ninto the United States and was likely exposed there. This case remains the only classic BSE \\ncase identified in the United States, although cases of atypical BSE have been found. Experts \\neventually concluded that the spread of infection in cattle was likely tied to feeding \\npractices. They speculate it began when cows were fed meat and bone meal from other \\ncows that had prion disease. CWD is a prion disease that affects animals like deer, elk, \\nmoose, and reindeer. It has been found in the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, and \\nSweden. Imported cases have also been reported in South Korea. First recognized in \\nColorado in the late 1960s, CWD has now been identified in 32 U.S. states. Though there \\nhave been no cases of CWD in people, experts think it poses a theoretical risk to people. This \\nis because CWD is related to BSE, which has caused disease in people. If CWD could spread \\nto people, hunters and people who eat meat from CWD-infected animals would likely be \\nmost at risk.

Transplant transmitted infections are very rare; public health entities and \\nacademic groups suspect about 1% of transplants cause infections and have confirmed \\ncases in far fewer. When these events occur, the complications can include graft failure or \\ndeath. Efforts to improve transplant safety are ongoing, (for example, improvements to \\ndonor screening and donor testing) and informed by investigations of disease transmission \\nfrom transplanted organs and tissues. CDC is responsible for surveillance, detection, and \\nwarning of potential public health risks within the organ and tissue supply. These public \\nhealth efforts increase transplant safety by reducing the potential for transmission of \\ncommunicable diseases. Although infrequent, transplants can transmit infections that affect \\npatients' health, including: To the body, transplanted organs are foreign. When the body \\nattacks transplanted organs, it is known as rejection. To prevent this response, doctors \\nprescribe medication to organ recipients.

Hospitals are required to have written agreements with \\norganizations that coordinate organ and tissue donation and recovery. There are 57 organ \\nprocurement organizations (OPOs) and a larger number of tissue recovery and eye recovery \\nbanks that work with hospitals in the United States for this purpose. Hospitals also obtain \\norgans (kidneys and livers) from living donors. Organ procurement organizations (OPOs) \\nadminister questionnaires to collect: OPOs, tissue banks, and eye banks are also required to \\nperform certain tests to see if the potential donor may have infections (e.g.,human \\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV),hepatitis Borhepatitis Cvirus,syphilis,and cytomegalovirus \\n(CMV)). They provide test results to the healthcare facility where organ or tissue \\ntransplantation occur. Hospitals evaluate living potential donors for behaviors or medical \\nhistory that may increase the risk of infection in the donor. The Organ Procurement and \\nTransplantation Network (OPTN) requires organizations procuring organs to report \\nsuspected donor-derived disease transmissions to the OPTN and all centers receiving \\npotentially affected organs. Additionally, OPOs must contact tissue banks and eye banks that \\nrecovered tissues from that same donor. Tissue and eye banks are required to investigate if \\nthey suspect transplanted tissue caused an infection and: The tissue or eye bank that \\nreleased the tissue must submit findings to theFDAthrough itsMedWatchsurveillance \\nsystem. CDC encourages healthcare facilities performing tissue transplants to report \\nsuspected transmissions to the tissue supplier through the MedWatch system. Reporting is \\nvoluntary. When living patients donate organs, the hospitals performing the procedure \\nmust notify local or state public health authorities if the donor has a notifiable infectious \\ndisease. Each state maintains a list of notifiable diseases found on the health department's \\nwebsite. CDC helps the healthcare community, state, and local health departments trace \\ndiseased organs back to the original donor and identify people who may have received \\ncontaminated organs and/or tissue. This process informs regulatory decisions and risk \\nreduction guidance for transplant safety. CDC laboratories can also help test for and identify \\nbacteria, viruses, etc. that may contaminate organs and tissues.

Use soap and clean water and to wash bottles, pacifiers, and toys that fall \\non the floor. Mosquitoes can spread diseases, such asZika,chikungunya,malaria,dengue, \\nandyellow fever. Ticks can spread diseases such asLyme diseaseand Tick-borne \\nencephalitis. Children can be protected against most of these diseases by \\nusingEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellentswith one of the \\nfollowing active ingredients: When using insect repellent on your child, always follow label \\ninstructions. Spray insect repellent onto your hands and then apply to a child?s face.Do not \\nuseproducts containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on children under 3 \\nyears old.Do notapply insect repellent to a child?s hands, eyes, mouth, cuts, or irritated skin. \\nIf also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first. More steps to protect your child include \\ndressing them in clothing that covers the arms and legs. Cover strollers and baby carriers \\nwith mosquito netting. Malaria is a serious infection that children can get while traveling \\ninternationally. Children visiting friends and relatives in areas with malaria may be at \\nhigher risk because they usually stay for longer periods of time. Children traveling to an \\narea with malaria should take malaria prevention medicine. Your health care professional \\ncan help you know which medicine your child should take. Many malaria prevention \\nmedicines have a bitter taste, but a pharmacist can crush the capsules and put the powder \\nin a flavorless gelatin capsule. Because of the risk of overdose, malaria drugs should be \\nstored in childproof containers and kept out of the reach of children. Even if you are taking \\nmalaria medicine you should still use bug spray and take other steps toavoid bug bites. \\nRabiesis spread primarily through contact (bites, scratches, or licks) withanimals that can \\nhave rabies (mammal). Rabies is almost always fatal if not treated promptly. Children are at \\ngreater risk for rabies because they are smaller than adults, may play with animals and may \\nnot report bites. Supervise children closely around animals, especially around dogs and \\npuppies, cats and kittens, and wildlife. Any animal bite should be washed thoroughly with \\nsoap and water and you should seek medical attention immediately. Children should always \\nwear a seat belt or sit in appropriate car and booster seats. Research car seat guidelines for \\nthe country you are going to; a car seat from the United States may not be approved in \\nanother country for use. In general, children are safest traveling in the back seat. No one \\nshould ever travel in the back of a pickup truck. SeeTraffic and Road Safetyfor more tips to \\navoid getting in an accident. When doing water activities, supervise children closely and \\nhave them wear a life jacket.

Infection develops in stages (primary, \\nsecondary, latent, and tertiary). Each stage can have different signs and symptoms. Babies \\ncan also get syphilis.Congenital syphilisis the disease that happens when people pass \\nsyphilis to their babies during pregnancy. There are four stages of syphilis (primary, \\nsecondary, latent, and tertiary). Each stage has different signs and symptoms. During the \\nfirst (primary) stage of syphilis, you may notice a single sore or multiple sores. The sore is \\nthe location where syphilis entered your body. These sores usually occur in, on, or around \\nthe Sores are usually (but not always) firm, round, and painless. Because the sore is \\npainless, you may not notice it. The sore usually lasts 3 to 6 weeks and heals regardless of \\nwhether you receive treatment. Even after the sore goes away, you must still receive \\ntreatment. This will stop your infection from moving to the secondary stage. During the \\nsecondary stage, you may have skin rashes and/or sores in your mouth, vagina, or anus. \\nThis stage usually starts with a rash on one or more areas of your body. The rash can show \\nup when your primary sore is healing or several weeks after the sore has healed. The rash \\ncan be on the palms of your hands and/or the bottoms of your feet and look The rash \\nusually won't itch, and it is sometimes so faint that you won't notice it. Other symptoms may \\ninclude The symptoms from this stage will go away whether you receive treatment. Without \\nthe right treatment, your infection will move to the latent and possibly tertiary stages of \\nsyphilis. The latent stage of syphilis is a period when there are no visible signs or symptoms. \\nWithout treatment, you can continue to have syphilis in your body for years. Most people \\nwith untreated syphilis do not develop tertiary syphilis. However, when it does happen, it \\ncan affect many different organ systems. These include the heart and blood vessels, and the \\nbrain and nervous system. Tertiary syphilis is very serious and would occur 10?30 years \"),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 865, 'page_label': '948'}, page_content='after your infection began. In tertiary syphilis, the disease damages your internal organs \\nand can result in death. A healthcare provider can usually diagnose tertiary syphilis with the \\nhelp of multiple tests. Without treatment, syphilis can spread to the brain and nervous \\nsystem (neurosyphilis), the eye (ocular syphilis), or the ear (otosyphilis). This can happen \\nduring any of the stages described above. Signs and symptoms of neurosyphilis can include \\nSigns and symptoms of ocular syphilis can include Signs and symptoms of otosyphilis may \\ninclude Sexually active people can get syphilis through vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a \\ncondom with a partner who has syphilis. If you are sexually active, have an honest and open \\ntalk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for syphilis or other \\nSTIs. Syphilis may be more common in some racial/ethnic and sexual minority groups. For \\ninstance, gay and bisexual men are disproportionately impacted by syphilis. In addition, \\npeople from racial and ethnic minority groups are experiencing the brunt of the congenital \\nsyphilis epidemic. These disparities are due tosocial, cultural, and economic conditionsthat \\nmake it difficult for sexually active people to stay healthy. Having a sore or break in the skin \\nfrom an STI such as syphilis may allow HIV to more easily enter your body. You may also be \\nmore likely to get HIV because the same behaviors and circumstances that put you at risk \\nfor getting other STIs can also put you at greater risk for getting HIV. You can get syphilis by \\ndirect contact with a syphilis sore during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. People can alsopass \\nsyphilis to their baby during pregnancy. You cannot get syphilis through casual contact with \\nobjects, such as The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral \\nsex. If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of \\ngetting syphilis: Condomsprevent the spread of syphilis by preventing contact with a sore. \\nSometimes sores occur in areas not covered by a condom. Contact with these sores can still \\ntransmit syphilis. If you arepregnantand have syphilis,you can give the infection to your \\nbaby. Having syphilis can lead to a low-birth-weight-baby. It can make it more likely you \\nwill deliver your baby too early or stillborn (a baby born dead). To protect your baby,you \\nshould receive syphilis testing at least once during your pregnancy. Receive treatment right \\naway if you test positive. At birth, a baby with a syphilis infection may not have signs or \\nsymptoms of disease. However, if the baby does not receive treatment right away, the baby \\nmay develop serious problems within a few weeks. These babies can have health problems, \\nsuch as cataracts, deafness, or seizures, and can die. You should get tested regularly for \\nsyphilis if you are sexually activeand All pregnant people should receive syphilis testing at \\ntheir first prenatal visit. Some pregnant people need to receive syphilis testing again during \\nthe third trimester at 28 weeks and at delivery. Most of the time, healthcare providers will \\nuse a blood test to test for syphilis. Some will diagnose syphilis by testing fluid from a \\nsyphilis sore. Yes, syphilis is curable with the right antibiotics from your healthcare \\nprovider. However, treatment might not undo any damage the infection can cause. Having \\nsyphilis once does not protect you from getting it again. Even after successful treatment, \\nyou can get syphilis again. Only laboratory tests can confirm whether you have syphilis. \\nFollow-up testing by your healthcare provider is necessary to make sure your treatment \\nwas successful. It may not be obvious that a sex partner has syphilis. Syphilis sores in the \\nvagina, anus, mouth, or under the foreskin of the penis, can be hard to see.

Several vaccine lots have been recalled in recent years because of a possible safety \\nconcern before anyone reported any injury. Rather, the manufacturer's quality testing \\nnoticed some irregularity in some vaccine vials. In these cases, the safety of these vaccines \\nwas monitored continuously before and after they were in use. CDC analyzed reports to \\ntheVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)to search for any side effects that \\nmight have been caused by the irregularity, and found none. Any time such an irregularity is \\nfound in a vaccine lot which could make it unsafe, the manufacturer, in collaboration with \\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will recall it immediately. Information on \\nrecalled lots of is available by year fromFDA. Vaccine recalls or withdrawals are almost \\nalways initiated voluntarily by the vaccine manufacturer. The FDA rarely issues a recall, and \\nif safety is a concern, the recall is immediate. The manufacturer contacts vaccine \\ndistributors and healthcare facilities who might have purchased the vaccine to inform them \\nof the suspected problem. Whenever a vaccine lot is to be recalled, FDA's role is to oversee a \\nmanufacturer's strategy and help ensure the recall goes well. You would most likely hear \\nfrom your doctor if a vaccine given to you or your child is recalled. When a recalled product \\nhas been widely distributed, the news media often reports on the recall. Not all recalls are \\nannounced in the media, but all recalls are listed in FDA's weeklyEnforcement Reports. Also, \\ninformation on vaccines that have been recalled in the past few years is available at \\nFDA'sRecalled Vaccinespage. In many cases, the person who is vaccinated will not need to \\ndo anything after a vaccine is recalled. When a vaccine recall is due to low vaccine potency \\nor strength, vaccines from the lot might not produce an immune response that is strong \\nenough to protect against disease. People who were vaccinated with a vaccine from that lot \\nmight need to be vaccinated again to ensure they are protected against the disease. When a \\nrecall is related to a possible safety concern noted by the manufacturer, people who were \\nvaccinated should be aware of their reaction to the vaccine, and talk to their doctor if they \\nhave any concerns that they may be having a reaction.

Rubella, causes fever, sore throat, rash, \\nheadache, and red, itchy eyes. If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have \\na miscarriage, or her baby could be born with serious birth defects. Due to high vaccination \\nrates, outbreaks of measles, mumps, and rubella in the U.S. are not as common as they were \\nbefore the vaccine began being used.

MMR vaccine rarely causes a temporary low \\nplatelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder that usually goes away without \\ntreatment and is not life threatening. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most \\npeople who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Getting MMR \\nvaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella. MMR vaccine has been \\nlinked with a very small risk offebrile seizures. Febrile seizures following MMR vaccination \\nare rare and are not associated with any long-term effects. Because the risk of febrile \\nseizures increases as infants get older, it is recommended that they get vaccinated as soon \\nas recommended. Extremely rarely, a person may have a serious allergic reaction to MMR \\nvaccine. Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic \\nneomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine. No \\npublished scientific evidence shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine \\nintothree individual shots. Measles outbreaks can occur in communities with a high number \\nof unvaccinated people. Maintaining high overall MMR vaccination rates is needed to \\ncontinue to limit the spread of measles. Because signs of autism may appear around the \\nsame time children receive the MMR vaccine, some parents may worry that the vaccine \\ncauses autism. Vaccine safety experts, including experts at CDC and the American Academy \\nof Pediatrics (AAP), agree that MMR vaccine is not responsible for recent increases in the \\nnumber of children with autism.

The evidence \\naccumulated over many years do not show any links between childhood immunization and \\nSIDS. Placing healthy babies on their backs to sleep reduces the risk of SIDS. In 1992, the \\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics recommended that healthy babies be placed on their backs \\nto sleep. That recommendation, along with the National Institute of Child Health and Human \\nDevelopment\\'s 1994 \"Back-to-Sleep\" campaign (now known as theSafe to Sleep® \\ncampaign), encouraged caregivers to place infants on their backs to sleep, and coincided \\nwith a dramatic reduction in the SIDS rate in the United States.See the latest \\nrecommendations on a safe infant sleep environmentfrom the American Academy of \\nPediatrics.

Methylmercury is the type of \\nmercury found in certain kinds of fish. At high exposure levels methylmercury can be toxic \\nto people. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible \\nout of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some \\nmethylmercury. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body \\nmore quickly than methylmercury, and is therefore less likely to cause any harm. \\nThimerosal is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose (multi-dose vials) \\nto prevent growth of germs, like bacteria and fungi. Introduction of bacteria and fungi has \\nthe potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for \\nadministration. Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, \\nserious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added \\nduring the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth. Thimerosal was taken out of \\nchildhood vaccines in the United States in 2001. For a complete list of vaccines and their \\nthimerosal content level, see the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Thimerosal in \\nVaccinespage.

BSE is sometimes called \"mad cow disease.\" vCJD was \\nfirst reported in the United Kingdom in 1996. Worldwide, there have been 233 people \\nreported to have vCJD since its discovery. The vast majority of illnesses occurred in the \\nUnited Kingdom in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There were also cases reported in \\nEurope, Asia, the Middle East, the United States and Canada. It can take years for someone \\nto develop vCJD symptoms after they were exposed to BSE. But, once symptoms begin, it is \\nalways fatal. Most people with vCJD live with the illness for one to two years, with an \\naverage time of 13-14 months. As with other prion diseases, it takes a long time for people \\nto get sick after contact with the prion. This timeframe can be 10 years or more. People with \\nvCJD have obvious psychiatric (mental, emotional, behavioral) symptoms. Often, this '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 908, 'page_label': '991'}, page_content='includes depression, anxiety and withdrawal. They may also have a painful condition called \\ndysesthesia. This may feel like itching, burning, pins and needles or other sensations on \\ntheir body. Later in the illness, patients typically have dementia and neurologic signs such \\nas poor coordination. Of the 233 vCJD illnesses reported since 1996, four vCJD illnesses \\nhave been reported in the United States. Three occurred between 2001 and 2006. A fourth \\nhad vCJD symptoms beginning in 2012. It is believed that all four people with vCJD in the \\nU.S. contracted the disease in another country. Two of the four patients had lived for \\ndecades in the United Kingdom. A third was born and raised in Saudi Arabia before coming \\nto the United States. It\\'s not clear where the fourth patient may have been exposed, but \\nexperts agreed it was likely outside the US. A few more recent vCJD illnesses occurred in lab \\npersonnel and may have been exposed to prions in the lab. There is strong evidence vCJD is \\ncaused when people eat meat from cows that were infected with Bovine Spongiform \\nEncephalopathy (BSE). BSE was first identified in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and \\ncases peaked in the early 1990s. The first vCJD cases were reported in 1996. Feeding cattle \\nmeat and bone meal from dead cows, some of which had BSE, contributed to the large U.K. \\noutbreak. Policies to prevent further exposure of animals and humans to BSE led to a \\ndramatic decline in BSE cases. These included animal feed bans and the removal of \\ninfectious cattle tissues, such as the brain, from human food. Scientists believe people may \\nhave eaten food potentially contaminated with BSE in the mid-1980s. vCJD cases started \\nappearing about 10 years later. This matches the usual incubation period (the time between \\nexposure and symptoms) for other prion diseases. Preventing vCJD primarily involves \\navoiding BSE. Given the how rare BSE is and protective measures in place, there are no \\nspecific  vCJD prevention measures needed now. There is no specific test to diagnose vCJD \\nwhile a patient is alive. Healthcare providers look at a number of factors when deciding if \\nsomeone has vCJD: To confirm the patient had vCJD, scientists must examine brain tissue \\ngathered during an autopsy. They look for changes in the brain that are specific to vCJD. \\nThere is unfortunately no cure for vCJD. No specific therapy slows or stops the disease\\'s \\nprogression once symptoms begin. Treatment involves providing supportive care to help \\nmake the person more comfortable as their illness progresses. Though they have very \\nsimilar names, vCJD is not the same disease as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The latter is often \\ncalled \"classic CJD\" to avoid confusion. Both are caused by prions, misfolded proteins that \\nclump together in brain tissue. As they do, they cause brain damage. Over time, the brain \\ndamage gets worse, eventually causing the person\\'s death. Some of thedifferences between \\nthe two diseasesinclude: Probable Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in a U.S. \\nResident?Florida, 2002, MMWR.

Applications for 2026 rotations will be open from January 31, 2025 to April \\n30, 2025. Contact us atepielective@cdc.gov. The Epidemiology Elective Program (EEP) is a \\nshort-term, service-learning rotation in applied epidemiology. Medical and veterinary \\nstudents learn through training, project assignments, and mentorship from public health \\nexperts. Students can participate in a 6- or 8-week rotation. Projects assignments are with \\nCDC, other federal agencies, and state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments. Every \\neffort is made to place students with a host site that provides experience in leadership and \\nproject in a topic area of the student's interest. Project assignments involve helping public \\nhealth experts investigate public health problems such as infectious disease outbreaks, \\nnatural disasters, chronic diseases, and poor access to healthcare. Most schools award \\nacademic course credit for participation in EEP. More than 2,100 medical and veterinary \\nstudents have completed EEP since its inception in 1975.

Many parents can?t afford to pay for vaccines on their own. Being a \\nVFC Program provider is a sound investment in your practice and your patients? health.  \\nHere are some of the benefits of participating in the VFC Program: You don\\'t have to be a \\nMedicaid provider to participate in the VFC Program. Any healthcare provider (including \\npharmacists) authorized by their state law granting them the authority to administer \\nvaccines by prescription, vaccine protocol, or prescribing authority can be a VFC Program \\nprovider. To enroll in the VFC Program: VFC Program providers cannot charge their \\npatients for any vaccines given to eligible children. However, they can charge for other fees \\nassociated with a vaccination appointment. Types of fees a provider can charge: If a parent \\nor guardian cannot afford the fee (per vaccine), this fee must be removed so that they are \\nnot charged. A VFC Program provider cannot refuse vaccination for a VFC Program-eligible \\nchild due to the parent\\'s or guardian\\'s inability to pay for vaccine administration. All VFC \\nproviders are required to participate in annual, comprehensive training.VFC providers \\nshould check with their state, local, or territorial immunization program regarding \\nrequirements. CDC offers training modules and refresher test options that may fulfill these \\nrequirements. Providers can complete one or two VFC-related modules in the You Call the \\nShots course series. Continuing education (CE) credit is offered for each module. \\nExperienced healthcare professionals familiar with VFC and federal storage and handling \\nrequirements can opt to take a refresher test to demonstrate their knowledge on these \\nNote:No continuing education creditswill be awarded for completing either refresher test. \\nThe Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program provides vaccines to children whose parents or \\nguardians may not be able to afford them.

You can get cholera from drinking water or eating food containing cholera \\nbacteria. Most people who get cholera don't get sick. However, choleracan cause life-\\nthreatening watery diarrheaand vomiting. Every year, an estimated 1.3 to 4 million people \\naround the world get cholera, and between 21,000 to 143,000 people die. With early and \\nproper treatment, even severely ill patients can survive cholera. Most people who get \\ncholera have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. About 1 in 10 people develop severe \\nsymptoms such as watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. Losing body fluids quickly \\ncan lead to dehydration and shock. People living in areas with unsafe drinking water, poor \\nsanitation, and inadequate hygiene are at highest risk of getting cholera. U.S. residents can \\nget cholera while traveling abroad and sometimes become ill after returning home. Some \\ntravelers have gotten sick after bringing contaminated seafood home with them from \\nabroad. People usually get cholera from drinking water or eating food that contains traces \\nof poop from someone with cholera. The disease can spread quickly in areas where sewage \\nand drinking water aren't adequately treated. Cholera bacteria also can live in brackish \\n(slightly salty) and coastal waters. Eating raw shellfish can cause cholera. Cholera is not \\nlikely to spread from person to person or from casual contact with someone with cholera. If \\nyou plan to travel, check if cholera is common or ongoing in the area you are visiting. If \\ncholera is present, washing your hands with soap and safe water, drinking treated water, \\nand getting vaccinated against cholera are among the steps that can help prevent you from \\ngetting sick. If you think you or a family member might have cholera, get medical attention \\nimmediately. Dehydration can occur quickly and replacing lost fluids is essential. For babies \\nwith watery diarrhea, continue feeding them breast milk or formula to help them stay \\nhydrated. Treatment for cholera can include: Cholera, caused by the bacteria Vibrio \\ncholerae, is rare in the US and other industrialized nations.

Exposure to ash can be harmful. Ash is gritty, abrasive, sometimes corrosive, \\nand always unpleasant. Small ash particles can abrade (scratch) the front of the eye. Ash \\nparticles may contain crystalline silica, a material that causes a respiratory disease called \\nsilicosis. Infants, elderly people, and people with respiratory conditions such as asthma, \\nemphysema, and other chronic lung diseases may have problems if they breathe in volcanic \\nash. Most gases from a volcano quickly blow away. However, heavy gases such as carbon \\ndioxide and hydrogen sulfide can collect in low-lying areas. The most common volcanic gas \\nis water vapor, followed by carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Other volcanic gases include \\nhydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen fluoride. Amounts of these gases vary \\nwidely from one volcanic eruption to the next. Although gases usually blow away rapidly, it \\nis possible that people who are close to the volcano or who are in the low-lying areas \\ndownwind may be exposed to levels that may affect health.

Like all nerve agents, VX stops certain enzymes from working. When this \\nenzyme does not work correctly, muscles are constantly being used. As a result, people may \\nbecome tired and no longer be able to keep breathing. VX can remain in the environment \\nfrom days to months depending on the circumstances. VX's characteristics include: Signs \\nand symptoms depend on how much a person was exposed to, how the person was \\nexposed, and for how long. VX has no recognizable smell. Until signs and symptoms develop, \\npeople may not know that they were exposed. Exposure to a low or medium amount may \\ncause some or all the following signs and symptoms within seconds to hours: Even a small \\ndrop of VX on the skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching where VX touched the skin. \\nExposure to large amount of VX in any way may result in the following harmful health \\neffects: Because VX evaporates slowly, VX can be a short-term threat or a long-term threat. \\nVX can stay on surfaces and be dangerous for days to months. Follow any directions by local \\nauthorities. If VX is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or \\nbreathing in the VX gas. Because VX gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and \\nincrease the chance of exposure there. If VX is in water, people can be exposed by touching \\nor drinking the water. People can also be exposed to liquid VX by swallowing it, getting it on \\ntheir skin, or in their eyes. People can also touch or breathe in VX gas from clothes that have \\nbeen exposed to VX. Touching or eating food with VX can also expose people to VX. Avoid \\nusing or eating food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have \\ntouched VX if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken \\nsealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by VX. Wash the outside of the \\ncontainer before using. Get awayfrom the area where the VX was released and breathe fresh \\nair. If the VX release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are \\nclosed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the VX does not come inside. If \\nyou cannot go indoors, leave the area where the VX was released. If you cannot get away \\nfrom the area, go to the highest ground possible. VX is heavier than air and will sink to \\nlower areas. If the VX release was indoors, get out of the building. Make sure you \\nunderstand your local emergency notification system if you have one. Listen to emergency \\nbroadcasts and local authorities for instructions. Get cleanby taking off all clothes, jewelry, \\nand accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. This is the best way to remove VX from \\nyour body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can. Do not pull \\nclothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and \\nmouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the VX  from getting in your eyes, nose, or \\nmouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag. If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them \\nwith your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.

Coagulationis often the \\nfirst step in water treatment. Treatment plant staff add chemicals to the water that help \\nbind together dirt and other small particles. The chemicals they commonly use include \\nspecific types of salts, aluminum, or iron. Flocculationis next. Flocculation is the gentle \\nmixing of the water to form larger, heavier particles called flocs. Often, treatment plant staff \\nwill add additional chemicals during this step to help the flocs form. \\nSedimentationseparates out solids from the water. Flocs are heavier than water, so they \\nsettle to the bottom of the water during this step. Filtrationis the next step. Once the flocs \\nhave settled to the bottom of the water, the clear water on top goes through several filters. \\nThe filters have different pore (hole) sizes and are made of materials such as sand, gravel, or \\ncharcoal. These filters remove germs, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses. They also \\nremove dissolved particles, such as dust and chemicals. Activated carbon filters remove bad \\nsmells. Utilities that use a process called ultrafiltration put water through a filter with very \\nsmall pores. This filter only lets through water and other small molecules (such as salts and \\ntiny, charged molecules). Reverse osmosisis another way to filter water that removes \\nadditional particles from water. Water treatment plants often use reverse osmosis when \\ntreatingrecycled wateror salt water for drinking. Disinfectionis often the last step. Water \\ntreatment plants may add one or more chemical disinfectants to kill any remaining germs. \\nCommon types of chemical disinfectants includechlorine, chloramine, or chlorine dioxide. \\nTreatment plant staff make sure the water has low levels of the chemical disinfectant when \\nit leaves the treatment plant. This remaining disinfectant killsgerms living in the \\npipesbetween the water treatment plant and your tap. Water treatment plants can also \\nuseultraviolet (UV) lightorozoneto disinfect water.

People come in contact with water often each day, making it even harder \\nto know which exposure might have made a person sick. Finally, it can take several days or \\neven weeks to become ill after being exposed to a germ, making it difficult to pinpoint the \\nplace and time of exposure.Without an outbreak investigation, it can be difficult or \\nimpossible to link illnesses to water. When a group of people become ill at the same time, an \\ninvestigation that collects information on timing and location of exposures and illnesses \\n(known as an epidemiologic investigation) can help determine where and when the \\noutbreak started and what caused it. An outbreak investigation can sometimes identify a \\ndirect link between the illnesses and contaminated water and might identify the type of \\nwater, systems, or settings involved. This information is difficult to gather outside of an \\noutbreak (such as with individual infections). For an event to be defined as a waterborne \\ndisease outbreak Public health officials have been tracking waterborne disease in the \\nUnited States for more than 100 years. CDC has been overseeing national waterborne \\ndisease and outbreak trackingsince 1971. Surveillance data help guide efforts to reduce and \\nprevent future outbreaks. Waterborne disease surveillance data have supported national \\nefforts to develop drinking water regulations and have provided guidance for recreational \\nwater activities, such as CDC'sHealthy Swimmingprogram. The nationalWaterborne Disease \\nand Outbreak Surveillance System(WBDOSS) collects data on waterborne disease and \\noutbreaks associated with recreational water, drinking water, and environmental and \\nundetermined exposures to water. The system collects data on the number of outbreak-\\nassociated illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths; agents; implicated types of water; water \\nsystems; and water settings. WBDOSS also collects information on single cases of \\nwaterborne illness caused by certain types of chemicals or germs. Public health officials \\ninvestigate outbreaks to control them, to prevent additional illnesses, and to learn how to \\nprevent similar outbreaks from happening. Anyone who suspects an outbreak is occurring \\nshould contact their local or state health department. The 8 steps in an outbreak \\ninvestigation are: Several steps may happen at the same time in an outbreak investigation. \\nOnce a waterborne disease outbreak investigation ends, public health departments report \\noutbreaks to WBDOSS. Waterborne disease outbreaks became nationally notifiable in the \\nUnited States in 2009. Public health agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. \\nterritories, and Freely Associated States have primary responsibility for identifying and \\ninvestigating waterborne outbreaks and reporting outbreaks voluntarily to CDC. From 1971 \\nto 2008, outbreaks were reported using a paper form.

A healthy person with normal liver \\nand kidney function can excrete excess dietary manganese. Inhaled manganese is of greater \\nconcern because it bypasses the body\\'s normal defense mechanisms. This can lead to \\nmanganese accumulation and damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys and central nervous \\nsystem. Male workers exposed to manganese also have a higher risk of fertility problems. \\nProlonged exposure to high manganese concentrations (>1 mg/m3) in air may lead to a \\nParkinsonian syndrome known as \"manganism.\" Chronic exposure to the manganese-\\ncontaining pesticide, maneb, may cause Parkinson-like symptoms. Parkinson-like \\nsymptoms may include tremors, slowness of movement, muscle rigidity, and poor balance. \\nNeurological and Neurobehavioral Effects Numerous studies indicate that welders may be \\nat increased risk of neurological and neurobehavioral health effects when exposed to metals \\nsuch as lead, iron, and manganese. Carbon monoxide, heat, and stress can also contribute to \\nneurological impairments in welders. Some studies indicate that welders exposed to low \\nlevels of manganese (<0.2 mg/m3) perform more poorly on tests of brain function and \\nmotor skills. These effects include changes in mood and short-term memory, altered '),\n Document(metadata={'source': '/kaggle/input/drug-pdf-488/DiseaseWithEverydetails-merged.pdf', 'page': 938, 'page_label': '1021'}, page_content='reaction time, and reduced hand-eye coordination. Affected workers frequently show \\nabnormal accumulations of manganese in the region of the brain known as the globus \\npallidus, which plays an important role in movement regulation. Welder\\'s Anthrax NIOSH \\nresearchers identified a new occupational disease among metalworkers calledwelder\\'s \\nanthrax. It is a rare but serious disease caused by the bacteria that produces anthrax toxin. \\nResearch suggests that exposure to metal fumes might increase workers\\' risk for lung \\ninfection. This is true even with common, relatively harmless infectious agents. It is still \\nmostly unknown how metal fumes cause this disease. Theories include that metal fumes (or \\niron) act as a growth nutrient for bacteria, enhance the binding of bacteria to lung tissues, \\nor impair immune responses in the lung through oxidative stress. Exposure to manganese \\ndust occurs primarily in mining, ore-crushing, and metallurgical operations for iron, steel, \\nferrous and nonferrous alloys. Manufacturing of the following products can also lead to \\nmanganese exposure: Manganese fumes are produced during metallurgical operations and \\nseveral types of welding operations. The exposure can vary considerably depending on the \\namount of manganese in the welding wire, rods, flux and base metal. Confined space \\nwelding can significantly increase exposure to manganese fumes.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that \\nlives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist \\nclimates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical \\ndiseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected \\npopulations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and \\neffective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in \\nthe affected communities. Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's \\nintestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when \\ninfected people defecate (poop) outside, useunimproved sanitation facilities(when there is \\nno sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as \\nfertilizer. Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites \\nglobally.

People with only a few worms \\n(light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can \\ncause a range of health problems, including To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted \\nhelminth infections Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it \\nfor a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope. Only prescription drugs can \\ntreat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and \\nmebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and \\nthree days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your \\nhealthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite. In certain \\ntropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-\\ntransmitted helminth infections (hookworm,?Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often \\nreceive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or \\n\"preventive chemotherapy\". The high-risk groups identified by the World Health \\nOrganization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including \\npregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and \\nadults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs \\noften provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger \\nchildren.

One reason public health authorities study the disease is \\nbecause the bacteria that cause melioidosis might be used as a weapon in a biological attack. \\nA biological attack is the intentional release of pathogens (germs) that can sicken or kill \\npeople, livestock, or crops. We don\\'t know if this kind of attack will ever happen. CDC and \\nother federal agencies prepare for many of biological attacks to protect as many people as \\npossible.

The objectives are \\nto improve blood pressure control and reduce disparities in cardiovascular health. \\nWISEWOMAN helps integrate innovative, evidence-based strategies for heart disease and \\nstroke prevention within health care systems and communities. Examples of these \\nevidence-based strategies: Read a summary of the implementation of theWISEWOMAN \\nProgram's Core Strategiesin Years 1 and 2 (2018?2020) and an evaluation of the program's \\nsuccesses. The WISEWOMAN program served nearly 150,000 women between 2008 and \\n2013?91% of whom had at least one risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Over 100,000 \\nwomen participated in a healthy lifestyle service to reduce their risk for heart disease and \\nstroke. The services provided by each WISEWOMAN program vary, but all are designed to \\npromote lifelong heart-healthy lifestyle changes. The WISEWOMAN (Well-Integrated \\nScreening and Evaluation for WOMen Across the Nation) program serves low-income, \\nuninsured, and underinsured women ages 40 to 64 years.

However, they can spread to humans through the skin. When they infect \\npeople, the hookworms can cause a disease called cutaneous larva migrans (CLM). People \\nbecome infected when young hookworms, known as larvae, burrow into unprotected skin. \\nThis can happen when people are walking barefoot or sitting (with exposed skin) on soil or \\nsand contaminated by animal feces. Zoonotic hookworm larva cause CLM by burrowing into \\nthe skin of a person's foot or body. This burrowing can cause: These symptoms will go away \\nafter several weeks as the parasite dies. In rare cases, some types of hookworm may infect \\ndeeper tissue in the intestine, lungs, or possibly the eye. Cases of CLM often occur in people \\nwho have traveled to tropical regions where dog and cat hookworm larvae can survive in \\nthe soil. If you walk barefoot in soil or sand in these regions, you can get zoonotic \\nhookworm. However, you can find zoonotic hookworms anywhere in the world. In the \\nUnited States, they're more common on the East Coast than the West Coast. If you have \\nsymptoms of CLM, speak with your healthcare provider.

This is because factor IX levels take more time to develop and are not at a \\nnormal level until a baby is at least 6 months of age. Therefore, a mildly low level of factor IX \\nat birth does not necessarily mean that the baby has hemophilia B. A repeat test when the \\nbaby is older might be needed in some cases. Learn more about theinheritance pattern for \\nhemophilia. About 1 in 3 babies who are diagnosed with hemophilia have no other family \\nmembers with the disorder. A doctor might check for hemophilia in a newborn if If a child \\nwith hemophilia  is not diagnosed during the newborn period, the family might notice \\nunusual bruising once the child begins standing or crawling. Those with severe hemophilia \\ncan have serious bleeding problems right away and are often diagnosed during the first year \\nof life. People with milder forms of hemophilia might not be diagnosed until later in life. \\nMany people who have or have had family members with hemophilia will ask that their \\nbaby be tested soon after birth. Diagnosis includes screening tests and clotting factor \\ntests.Screening testsare blood tests that show if the blood is clotting properly.Clotting factor \\ntests, also called factor assays, determine the clotting activity of factors VIII and IX in the \\nblood. Factors VIII and IX are proteins in the blood that help form clots and stop bleeding. \\nScreening tests are blood tests that show if the blood is clotting properly. Types of screening \\ntests include the following: This test measures the amount of hemoglobin (the red pigment \\ninside red blood cells that carries oxygen), the size and number of red blood cells, and \\nnumbers of different types of white blood cells and platelets found in blood. The CBC might \\nbe normal in people with hemophilia. However, if a person with hemophilia has unusually \\nheavy bleeding or bleeds for a long time, the hemoglobin and the red blood cell count can be \\nlow. This test measures how long it takes for blood to clot. It measures the clotting ability of \\nfactors VIII (8), IX (9), XI (11), and XII (12). If any of these clotting factors is too low, it takes \\nlonger than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will show a longer clotting \\ntime among people with hemophilia A or B. This test also measures the time it takes for \\nblood to clot. It measures primarily the clotting ability of factors I (1), II (2), V (5), VII (7), \\nand X (10). If any of these factors are too low, it takes longer than normal for the blood to \\nclot. The results of this test will be normal among most people with hemophilia A and B. \\nThis test also helps doctors assess a patient's ability to form a blood clot. This test is \\nordered either along with other blood clotting tests or when a patient has an abnormal PT \\nor APTT test result, or both. Fibrinogen is another name for clotting factor I. Clotting factor \\ntests, also called factor assays, determine the clotting activity of factors VIII and IX in the \\nblood.

In 2021, 1,820 children died of abuse \\nand neglect in the United States.4 Children living in poverty experience more abuse and \\nneglect. Experiencing poverty can place a lot of stress on families, which may increase the \\nrisk for child abuse and neglect. Rates of child abuse and neglect are five times higher for \\nchildren in families with low socioeconomic status compared to families with a higher \\nsocioeconomic status.1 Child maltreatment is costly. In the United States, the total lifetime \\neconomic burden associated with child abuse and neglect was about $592 billion in \\n2018.5This economic burden rivals the cost of other high-profile public health problems, \\nsuch as heart disease and diabetes.6 Children who are abused or neglected may suffer \\nimmediate physical injuries such as cuts, bruises, or broken bones.

The older adult \\npopulation is growing faster in the U.S. than are younger populations. The data \\nunderestimate the problem because the number of nonfatal injuries is limited to older \\nadults who are treated in emergency departments. The information doesn?t include those \\ntreated by other providers or those that do not need or do not seek treatment. Additionally, \\nmany cases are not reported because the older adult is afraid or unable to tell police, \\nfriends, or family about the violence. Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is \\nexperienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home.2From 2002 to 2016, more than \\n643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and \\nover 19,000 homicides occurred.3 Compared with women, men had higher rates of both \\nnonfatal assaults and homicides.34The rate for nonfatal assaults increased more than 75% \\namong men (2002?2016) and more than 35% among women (2007?2016).

Of the 6,188 victims, 62% were male. The perpetrator was an intimate \\npartner in 39% of firearm homicides and 12% of non-firearm homicides. Common contexts \\nof firearm homicides were familial or intimate partner problems, robbery or burglary, \\nargument, and illness-related (e.g. the homicide was perpetrated to end the suffering of an \\nill victim, both victim and perpetrator had an illness, or the perpetrator had a mental \\nillness).4 The economic cost of violent injuries against older adults is also substantial. A \\nrecent CDC study found that assault injuries to older adults in the United States cost almost \\n$33 billion in 2022.

Participation rates for workers of other age groups are \\nprojected to remain relatively level or decline. It is important to support and protect the \\nhealth and safety of workers, especially those of advanced age. Aging workers may provide \\nthe following benefits to their workplaces: Aging affects a variety of health conditions and \\noutcomes, including chronic conditions and the likelihood of workplace injury. More than \\n75% of all workers have at least one chronic condition. The two most common health \\nconditions affecting older workers are arthritis and hypertension. Nearly half of workers \\nover age 55 experience at least one of these conditions. Since many older workers \\nexperience chronic conditions, they may be absent from work. On the other hand, there may \\nbe an increase in \"presenteeism.\" Presenteeism is when workers show up to work sick. \\nOverall, older workers tend to experience fewer workplace injuries than their younger \\ncolleagues. This difference may be due to their experience or because they are more careful \\nand aware of their physical limitations. Older workers often require more time to heal from \\nworkplace injuries. It is important for employers to have a well-planned return to work \\nprogram. Older workers experience a higher rate of workplace fatalities.

They can quickly grow out of control, or \"bloom.\" Some of \\nthese blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick. Harmful algal \\nblooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also \\ngrow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see. Not all blooms \\nare harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the \\nenvironment if they: Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. \\nHowever, three types ?cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms?cause most blooms that \\nmake people and animals sick. Harmful algal blooms can grow in fresh water, salt water, or \\nbrackish water (a mixture of fresh and salt water). This includes water people use for \\nrecreation and for drinking. Harmful algal blooms occur across the world. In the United \\nStates, they have been reported in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \\nAlgae and cyanobacteria occur naturally in water. They are more likely to grow into a \\nharmful algal bloom when water is: Nutrients get into water when fertilizer, sewage, or \\nrunoff from cities and industrial buildings washes into lakes, rivers, or oceans.

It's named for a molecule, \\ngalactose-?-1,3-galactose, that's found in most mammals. Symptoms occur after people eat \\nred meat or are exposed to otherproducts made from mammals. Because of this, AGS is also \\nknown as red meat allergy or tick bite meat allergy. A CDC report showed that between \\n2010 and 2022, more than 110,000 suspected cases of AGS were identified. However, cases \\nof AGS are not nationally notifiable to CDC, so the actual number of AGS cases in the United \\nStates is not known. More data and research are needed to understand how many people \\nare affected by this condition. AGS is associated with tick bites. In the United States, AGS is \\nprimarily associated with the bite of a lone star tick, but other kinds of ticks have not been \\nruled out. Most reported cases of AGS in the United States occur in the South, East, and \\nCentral states. These are the areas where most lone star ticks are found. In other countries, \\nother tick species have been linked to AGS. While people in all age groups can develop AGS, \\nmost cases have been reported in adults.

Taking good care of the animal can decrease your pet's stress and the \\nchances of it getting sick. To keep your pet as healthy as possible, visit an exotic \\nveterinarian experienced in reptile and amphibian care (herpetology) for regular check-ups. \\nA veterinarian will not be able to prevent your reptile or amphibian from \\nsheddingSalmonellabecausethesebacteria are normally found in healthy reptiles and \\namphibians. If your pet becomes sick or dies soon after purchase, take it to the veterinarian \\nand inform the pet store or breeder about the pet's illness or death. Consider waiting before \\npurchasing or adopting another pet. Do not use the habitat until it has been properly \\ncleaned and disinfected. These practices will help prevent the spread of disease. Find a new \\nhome for your pet: Diseases can spread between animals and people. Learn how to stay \\nhealthy around pets and other animals.
